For one you didn&#39;t recognize any of the store names: &quot;Glitter&quot;, &quot;Jimmies&quot;, &quot;Jean Scene&quot;. Each with a moniker underneath to explain what they were &quot;Accessory Store&quot;, &quot;Ice Cream Shop&quot;, &quot;Clothing Store&quot;.

You&#39;d gotten a whole new wardrobe and a serious makeover, you took a moment to examine yourself. Your choice of $mallMadnessGirl as your avatar had become rather literal. It wasn&#39;t an exact match of course, since you were a real person, but you could see the resemblance. Luckily you hadn&#39;t been saddled with their absurdly long necks.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
How they would refer to you wasn&#39;t your real concern. How were you in this game? Why were you in a new form? How did this game even work?

The store name clearly recorded separately. 

//Really? An entire magical shopping mall, but it still has the shitty robot voice?//

Any chance you had to ask further questions was cut off as the girls suddenly hurried away, presumably towards the shoe store.

You glanced down at the shopping list that had appeared in your hand. No shoes on your list, so you had no real reason to follow. 

The game didn&#39;t need too much of an explanation, you had a shopping list, you had to get everything on it. First one to get them all and exit the mall wins.

&lt;&lt;if $traitShopaholic&gt;&gt;\
	@@.girlThought;OMG actual shopping! This is &#39;&#39;way&#39;&#39; better than playing some board game.@@

Though you were going to have to figure out how to approach the situation. You had your shopping list, but you&#39;d never gotten a chance to look at the layout of the mall.

Well you knew that the shoe store was in the direction the girls had run, and the sunglasses hut was around that corner, and the high end fashion store was all the way across the store on the second floor...Apparently you //did// know the layout of the entire mall which would make life a lot easier when they started announcing more sales.

Now came the question of strategy. This was a board game for little girls so there weren&#39;t too many different choices. 
1. You could try and move efficiently through your list, making sure you were always moving to the closest store. Though eventually you would run out of money and have to make the long trek to the ATM.
2. You could chase sales. You&#39;d end up running around a lot, but you wouldn&#39;t have to make so many ATM trips.

	You decided that chasing after sales would be the best option. Running back and forth from the ATM was bound to waste a bunch of your time.

	It seemed that the game supported those tactics. You&#39;d already gotten a few items on your list in no time at all. Though you were running to and fro none of the stores were //too// far away. Plus a lucky clearance sale meant that you skipped a whole visit to the ATM. 

	Maybe it wasn&#39;t surprising that a game all about shopping wanted to encourage a little &#39;bargain hunting&#39;, but you still felt clever for having figured it out.
	&lt;&lt;set $MMScore++&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	Chasing sales would be a good way to end up running around the mall like a chicken with it&#39;s head cut off. Surely it would be better to try and plot an efficient path between the stores, rather than getting stuck backtracking all the time.

	Though quickly enough several flaws were revealed in your plan. Trips to the ATM took you further out of the way than you&#39;d expected, and even when you got there it hardly dispensed any money at all. Worse still the second time you went there the ATM was actually //broken//. Meaning you were left with no money, and no way to get more, so you just had to sit there and wait until it was repaired.

	You&#39;d gotten a few items on your list, but it&#39;d taken way too long.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

//BZZT//

There was a sudden buzz from your bag, opening it up you were confronted with a painfully stereotypical purse full of items: lipstick, a compact, hand lotion, mascara...but the item that caught your attention was the cell phone. A //flip phone// of all things.

//This game is showing it&#39;s age.//

You had a text from &quot;Mall Administration&quot;. &lt;span class=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;Please respond with the name of a player you want to send for ice cream.&lt;/span&gt;

You doubted anyone needed anything from the ice cream store, it was just a chance to slow someone down. Who should you sabotage?

The whole mall was a simple rectangle, so no one ever got too far from the Food Court in the centre.

A table had already been selected for you and a snack had been provided. A diet Coke and a small fries. It seemed a little silly, but you did have to admit to feeling a little hungry. All this shopping was tiring work.

As you ate you tried to get a good look at the bags of the other girls. Not all items were of equal size, so it was tough to be sure who was winning. Sophie didn&#39;t have a lot of bags, but it looked like the ones she did were pretty full. Meanwhile Miki had a ton of nearly empty bags.

But you managed to push your way, picking something at random and throwing it haphazardly at the cashier. You felt better once it was actually in a bag, out of sight, out of mind.

With your final purchase made it was time to escape. Unfortunately your exit point was on the other side of the mall. This time you straight up ran. &lt;&lt;if $mallMadnessGirl === &quot;Megan&quot; || $mallMadnessGirl === &quot;Vanessa&quot;&gt;&gt;At least as fast as you could run in heels.

You stood in place, what little remained of your mind shutting down into an inhuman sleep.

...

...

...

As you waited in standby the game began to reset itself. Restoring the clothes to their original positions. Restocking the ATM. Clearing out any mess left by the players. And of course, resetting the NPCs.

There was a slight hitch as the reset procedure passed you. There were parameters defined about you which did not fit any existing NPC class. Additionally your appearance matched with one of the player characters. Obviously this was an error.

As you were found in the clothing store it defaulted you to a random NPC class normally found in that store.

Your body instantly snapped into a new form. Female Model 3-B. A pretty blonde girl with no distinctive traits. Designed to evoke a reaction of being pleasant enough to look at, but not enough to catch attention for long. Any details quickly forgotten once out of sight. Just another background character in the mall.

You were reset to a generic NPC class. Generic Clothing Shopper - Female. A simple routine which looped on trying new outfits. Would continue to loop indefinitely. The only complex part was waiting for audio input, ostensibly a compliment from a male NPC, but even that was simplified to just wait for //any// audio input. A player dropping something loud would be enough to progress the routine.

With the reset complete all the NPCs were left in standby. No sounds, no movement. Not even the rise and fall of a chest. Breathing was an unnecessarily complex behaviour to simulate. Players would never pay attention long enough to notice.

However, the other girls were delighted by the experience. Kara had won, but everyone had fun running around buying things they normally couldn&#39;t afford. There was a catharsis in @@.girlVoice;mindless shopping@@.

&lt;&lt;if $maxNPCTransformation === 2&gt;&gt;\
	A feeling you still knew all too well. The effects of your brush with @@.girlVoice;teenage shopping obsession@@ were still lingering in your mind. A cloying @@.girlVoice;need to shop@@ scratching at your conciousness. Mercifully it wasn&#39;t as overwhelming as before. You //really// wanted to @@.girlVoice;go to the mall@@, but you were able to restrain yourself. You&#39;d go tomorrow.
	
&lt;&lt;elseif $maxNPCTransformation === 3&gt;&gt;\
	However, you could feel the effects of your experience with &lt;&lt;if $knowledgeVideoGames &amp;&amp; $playerMaturity &gt;= 11&gt;&gt;NPChood&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;electronic doll-hood&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; still lingering. The @@.girlVoice;urge to shop@@ was still keen in your mind, and it felt like it had thrown out other things to make room for itself.

	You tried to think of the most complex math concept you knew, but instead got the difference between &quot;sale&quot; and &quot;clearance&quot;. A desire to learn about history buried under a desire to check out that @@.girlVoice;super cute jewelry store in the mall@@.

	&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt; 16&gt;&gt;\
		It wasn&#39;t the first time this had happened, but it was still concerning to feel it so keenly. You wondered what else had changed.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\

	As you walked back to the bench you felt you found yourself assaulted by some random thoughts. They weren&#39;t important or relevant, just the normal chatter of a busy human mind. The only reason you even noted it was because, back when you&#39;d been in that store, things had been so quiet. Just @@.girlVoice;mindlessly shopping@@ had been so simple and clear, it was almost a soothing experience. 

	Still you&#39;d rather have the noisiness. Something about that silence had been disturbing, an unnatural state, especially considering how much has been going.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;if $consideredTakingHand&gt;&gt;\
		For one brief terrible moment you&#39;d actually considered taking his hand. Having taken leave of your senses you&#39;d almost opened yourself up to @@.girlVoice;infection@@ at the hands of this @@.girlVoice;strange gross boy@@.

	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	You shook your head. You weren&#39;t about to start wandering around the mall with a stranger. The last thing you wanted was to be off somewhere wandering when Emily and the girls came back. She wouldn&#39;t leave you here, probably, but you didn&#39;t want to tempt fate.

	The boy looked confused for a moment. His hand hovering in the air as if he didn&#39;t understand what to do next. Eventually he seemed to reset, standing up straight, shrugging and walking away without another word. 
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

//Well that was strange.//

You pondered on that boy&#39;s existence. Assuming this was inside the board game, you and the girls should be the only real ones in here. So that boy must be some kind of NPC? A fake character that wandered around to fill out the world, moving through a simple set of instructions. Instructions that apparently included some rather &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 14&gt;&gt;lame&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 9&gt;&gt;@@.girlVoice;sweet@@&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;@@.girlVoice;gross@@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; flirting.

Though to your surprise after only a few moments you found yourself dozing. You wouldn&#39;t have said it was a particularly comfortable bench and yet you were increasingly tempted just to lie your head down and have a nap.

Actually that sounded like a fantastic idea. There wasn&#39;t anything else to do after all. Plus the girls were busy so they wouldn&#39;t be around to pull any childish pranks on your sleeping form.

You&#39;d just take a little nap. You&#39;d be rested...and refreshed...and...

You had to awkwardly just stand there, waiting for it to pass, your face contorting whenever a slight shift caused discomfort. The girls just looked at you like you&#39;d lost your mind. You felt like an idiot, even though you knew this was the best you could do.

You figured at this point she was probably going to just freeze your mouth so you couldn&#39;t talk, but she had other plans.

Your head tilted down so you could see your bare feet. You still had no ability to control them, so you couldn&#39;t shift away from the growing discomfort. You watched helplessly as your feet changed. 

Everything was losing definition. Your toes grew closer and closer together until the gaps between them had almost disappeared, yet you couldn&#39;t feel them pressing against each other. &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &gt;= 14&gt;&gt;The hair on your feet was entirely gone, they looked inhumanely smooth.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Your feet looked even smoother than before, smoother than any human foot should be.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Looking closer you could see that your nails were disappearing as well, blending into that unblemished smoothness. It didn&#39;t hurt, but it was deeply disconcerting. A feeling which didn&#39;t dissipate as your toes ceased to be toes, joining together in one single mass.

Your feet were now nothing more than featureless blocks. The overall shape was the same as before, but all the details were gone. Even the color was wrong. It was vaguely skin toned, but it didn&#39;t match with the actual flesh on your legs.

The transformation continued to crawl upwards, finally coming to a stop just above your now non-existent ankles. The girls looked shocked at the changes. Sophie and Kara whispering to each other as they glanced at your new &quot;feet&quot;. Emily didn&#39;t say anything, her message had been clear enough.

Each transformed inch gave a strange stiff sensation for only a moment before all sensation dulled down to almost nothing. You couldn&#39;t feel your feet at all, you couldn&#39;t even tell if they were still on the floor. 

As if in answer you found yourself tipped slightly forward onto the balls of your &quot;feet&quot;. It looked like you were standing on tiptoes...if you&#39;d still had toes. You couldn&#39;t see that you were actually supported by two small plastic poles running from your feet to the floor. Keeping you steady in place while giving the illusion you were @@.girlVoice;wearing heels@@.

The transformation continued up past your knees. Once it passed there was still a bend in that spot, but no actual articulation. Merely plastic shaped to preserve the humanoid appearance of your legs.

It continued past your thighs, starting to crawl onto your hips. Your body shifting position as you lost the ability to take the weight of your torso. From legs to hips you were perfectly straight, your torso leaned back slightly due to lack of support.

So not an actual woman, but you were being given the shape of one.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

As it flowed over your stomach new sensations began to spring up, starting from your feet. It was subtle...or perhaps it was obvious but your dulled sense of touch couldn&#39;t discern. But as the feeling washed over your feet and began it&#39;s way up your legs you felt...lighter, less substantial...hollow.

As it flowed down your arms they involuntarily straightened, held just away from your body. Your wrists bent slightly back, locking into place as your hands changed. Your hands maintained at least some of their former shape; you could still identify each finger and thumb. Though there were no fingerprints and the &quot;nails&quot; were just slight protrusions of the same plastic.

There was a slight crack where each shoulder met your torso. A spot that, in comparison to the rest of you, felt a little loose. A facsimile of a ball joint remained, allowing for multiple arm positions. 

Your mouth had already been frozen so you hadn&#39;t been able to speak for a while, but as your neck transformed, your vocal chords vanished. Without the air from your former lungs they wouldn&#39;t have worked anyway.

It moved up the back of your head, gently creeping around from all directions towards your face, but it paused there for a moment, as if unsure what came next.

			I can&#39;t say that playing &quot;Mall Madness&quot; went at all like I&#39;d expected. I&#39;d agreed to play a board game, yet in the end I got sucked into some fantasy world version of a shopping mall. I didn&#39;t have any interest in playing along with something that crazy. Though I ended up just getting into something crazier, a simple decision to follow some guy into a small shopping trip ended up with me nearly getting stuck in the damn game. I shudder at the thought.

Every item they bought ended up on either Miki or I. &lt;&lt;if $mannequinTransformation &gt;= 5&gt;&gt;My attempt to get out of it resulted in Emily turning me half into a store mannequin. So I didn&#39;t really have a choice.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; The clothes went away, but I&#39;ve still got a weird compulsion in my head. I keep thinking about the latest fashions, or hairstyles or whatever. It&#39;s distressing.

	However, your poker face was even worse than you&#39;d thought. Your eyes were wide, locked unflinchingly on the cupcake. You&#39;d even opened your mouth a bit, at this rate you might start to drool.

However, Sophie&#39;s attack had triggered something in the other girls. By silent agreement they&#39;d come to an inescapable conclusion. If you weren&#39;t going to fight back...

But your words fell on deaf ears as icing began to block your own ears. You felt dumb for not seeing this coming, and there was no telling when the attack would stop. Perhaps it was time to show them you weren&#39;t helpless?

She turned, only to take a pile of blue icing straight to the mouth.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Mmph! Blech,&quot;@@ Emily sputtered as she tried to clear the icing away. It wasn&#39;t that the icing tasted bad, it was actually delicious, but it was extremely sweet and unexpectedly having that high a dose all at once could be overwhelming.

But she wasn&#39;t mad, far from it, she looked thrilled that you&#39;d decided to join in. A look that was only marred by a sudden orange lump hitting her and a corresponding giggle from Miki.

With the battle joined in earnest you took your place among the melee. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 12&gt;&gt;At first you&#39;d tried to be precise and technical.

The piping bags had long since been emptied and no one had the time to refill them. So attacks had devolved to either throwing icing or trying to smear it on directly.

You had been both the aggressor and the victim in regards to both techniques and the five of you were simply covered in icing. The sounds of @@.girlVoice;squeals@@ and @@.girlVoice;giggles@@ ringing out with each attack. Your own &lt;&lt;if $traitGiggly || $playerAge &lt;= 12&gt;&gt;@@.girlVoice;shrill@@ &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;voice joining in with the chorus.

At first you&#39;d been somewhat reserved in your behaviour. Worried about running around too much, or making too much mess, but that concern had fled from your head. Now you were running around with the same reckless abandonment as the rest. If your mother saw your behaviour right now she&#39;d probably be furious; no one watching this scene could in good conscience call you the &#39;babysitter&#39;, when you were as much trouble as the rest.

&lt;&lt;if $traitImaginaryFriend &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;\
	$imaginaryFriendName was running around with the rest of you. Her own piping bag in her hand, though none of the girls noticed when she hit them.

	You couldn&#39;t help but fire at least a few shots her way. She made the funniest squeal when you hit her.

	&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Gotcha!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You shouted, much to the confusion of the other girls since, to them, you&#39;d just attacked empty air.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Though eventually all good things must come to an end. As icing reserves began to run low and non-iced space on you and the girls dropped, it was time to move on.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Okay okay. Truce! Truce!&quot;@@ Emily waved her arms, spraying icing everywhere, calling a halt to the hostilities.

With Kara&#39;s no nonsense attitude and Sophie acting as an enforcer, they were able to wrangle everyone into helping clean the remainder room. With five people on the job it was a shockingly quick task, and Emily managed to chip in with a little magic to lighten the load.

	&lt;&lt;if $cupcakeTriedOne&gt;&gt;Once the fight finally ended I actually got to try a cupcake.

But my gluttony was punished not by a stomach ache, but by literally getter fatter all at once.

Miki saved the day, clearly distressed at the situation she had moved across the room to you.

She stepped up to the makeshift starting line, the rest of the girls lined up on the side as judges. She took a small run before leaping into the air. She threw her legs apart into a full split before landing back down. Everyone clapped. Miki and Kara didn&#39;t seem super impressed giving a 7 and a 6 respectively. Sophie clearly appreciated something about it, giving an 8. You still didn&#39;t really know the benchmarks for these things so you stuck in the middle and went with a 7.

Kara was up next. It was clear that she was far less comfortable with this. She took no run up instead lifting up one leg and putting her arms above her head. She spun 90 degrees on her toe and put her other foot back down. It had been shaky, but maybe it was harder than it looked. The other girls were kind enough, giving 6s across the board, which you matched. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 7&gt;&gt;You were really glad Kara was the one keeping track of all of these @@.girlVoice;big numbers@@. Adding them up would be hard enough, let alone trying to remember them all.&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &lt;= 5&gt;&gt;You had @@.girlVoice;no idea how to add four numbers@@, let alone @@.girlVoice;figuring out which ones were bigger. You&#39;d just have to trust her.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Finally it was your turn, the first two movements hadn&#39;t been too crazy, and you were sure you could do something equally, if not more impressive.

What did you want to try?

Unbeknownst to you your hair had gotten tangled around your ankle, which mean you fell before you could even start.

In one way this was a mercy, since you hadn&#39;t built much speed the fall didn&#39;t really hurt. However, you had just enough forward momentum to cause you to roll once you landed. By the time you came to a halt you were @@.girlVoice;wrapped in your hair@@. Wrapped in such a way that you couldn&#39;t even stand. Freeing yourself was equally hopeless. With your arms pinned to your side you weren&#39;t able to much more than wiggle in place. You were stuck.

You craned your neck up to see the girls standing above you. Each of them holding back their laughter until they were sure you were okay. Once they&#39;d confirmed your safety they broke into a flurry of @@.girlVoice;giggles@@.

	&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Are you just going to laugh or are you going to help me get free?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

	&lt;&lt;changeEmbarassment &quot;small&quot;&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

In the end they did decide to help out, rolling you back the other way so that you were mostly free, though there was still some hair wrapped around your ankle.

Somehow it&#39;d managed to get itself into a knot that only Sophie small, yet strong, hands were able to get free.

However, your ordeal was not over. Rolling on the ground had not been kind to your hair, it was mess of @@.girlVoice;tangles and knots@@, covered in dirt and grass. Apparently it&#39;s magical ability to stay clean didn&#39;t extend to rolling around on the ground.

This left you in a conundrum. It was clear that your loose hair made it impossible to participate safely. Sophie said she couldn&#39;t braid it while it was that much of a mess. And Emily wasn&#39;t about to reverse the magic.

However she did have a partial solution, you wouldn&#39;t be able to participate, but at least your hair would be clean...

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;Your hair is so pretty,&quot;@@ she cooed, gently tugging the brush through a small tangle. Miki was quite gentle, so it wasn&#39;t as uncomfortable as you&#39;d expected. Luckily her work was almost done, there were only a few knots remaining. However it&#39;d taken the combined effort of the group to get it that way. While they were waiting for their next turn to compete they would take turns brushing your hair.

It was embarrassing to need all this help, but you couldn&#39;t deny how @@.girlVoice;nice@@ it felt now. It had been uncomfortable at first, when Sophie was working out the nastiest tangles, but now you really @@.girlVoice;liked it@@. &lt;&lt;if $traitCatgirl&gt;&gt;You even let out a small @@.girlVoice;purr@@ as Miki continued.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Of course it&#39;d be better if you never got the tangles in the first place, and just skipped to this part. Maybe you should just be a little less active...leave the jumping around to Sophie, while you could sit and @@.girlVoice;brush your hair@@. &lt;&lt;if $traitDaydreamer&gt;&gt;You really would be like @@.girlVoice;Princess Rapunzel@@, sitting in your tower.

The competition had finally come to an end, ending in the most predictable way. In truth there hadn&#39;t been much need for scoring, Sophie blew the rest of you away.

Your disastrous attempt meant that you were in dead last, apparently your attempt had been amusing enough to get a 20, but that still put you at the bottom of the pack. However, Emily said that since you had tried, it still counted as participating. But maybe next time you&#39;d actually accept her offers.

She stood at the end of the runway taking a breath before breaking into a sprint.

That was //way// more impressive than what the other girls did, and more than you could manage. She got 9s across the board.

She twisted, doing one full revolution before landing on one foot, her other leg perpendicular to the floor. Clearly at least some of that ballet training had stuck.

Your mind was already mulling over all the possible hiding spots in the house. The whole house was fair game, but you weren&#39;t allowed to go outside. You should have an advantage over most of the girls considering you actually lived here. However, they still might know about some weird nooks that you didn&#39;t. It might be a fairly even game.

With the game set there was only one major question that remained. Who would be hiding and who would be seeking? Of course it would switch around as the game went on, you never just played one game of hide and seek. But still someone had to start.

Emily eagerly stepped up, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;I&#39;ll go first, but we&#39;ll each take a turn seeking, okay?&quot;@@ 

Emily seeking was going to make this quite a bit tougher, she knew the place as well as you, and knew how you thought. Perhaps it was a little over the top to be strategizing this much for hide and seek against a bunch of elementary school girls...but you did want to win.

She wasn&#39;t allowed in yours and you weren&#39;t allowed in hers. So maybe, if you hid in your own, she&#39;d have the rule ingrained enough that she wouldn&#39;t even bother to check.

You hurried up to your room, trying your best to be quiet on the stairs. Pulling the closet door closed behind you, you tried to stay quiet. The slats in the door meant you could see out a little bit and would be able to keep an eye out.

	You had to laugh a little, you&#39;d used the same term when you were a kid. Some things never changed.

	She took your hand and started practically skipping down the halls. The rest of the game was lightning quick. Between her knowing the house and knowing the habits of her friends, she basically went straight to each. Miki was of particular amusement, as her hiding place under the bed did nothing to hide her feet. It seemed she was still getting the hang of hiding.

	There were some objections to you helping, but she assured everyone you weren&#39;t doing anything but following along. You were just her @@.girlVoice;little helper@@, and she&#39;d brought you along so you didn&#39;t get lonely.

Your vision went dark for a moment and you were struck by the sensations of fabrics running over your skin.

	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

	The top was a pale pink and the sleeves were multi-tiered with frills. However, the sleeves only actually started half way down your arm, leaving your shoulders and upper arms exposed.

	The bottoms were actually black shorts, and came to about mid thigh.

Luckily she didn&#39;t catch anything. Also, it seemed that you were right about her narrow thinking. She hadn&#39;t even come near the door to start her search, instead going upstairs to hunt down the other girls.

The complication now was how you&#39;d actually yourself back inside once enough time had passed. Too quickly and you&#39;d just be out in the open. Too long and the other girls who&#39;d been caught could catch you.

There was a touch and go moment where you were worried that Kara would going to actually check your secondary hiding spot despite having checked it before. But in the end she gave up and called you out.

It was a fairly standard tactic, but maybe Kara would be uncomfortable really searching through your mother&#39;s room. She might overlook something important, like you hiding in the closet.

Or maybe under the bed? You surveyed the room, considering all the possibilities. In truth you didn&#39;t come in here much either. Something about it was off putting, it made the hairs raise on the back of your neck. The room just filled you with a sense that //you shouldn&#39;t be here.// Though your mother had never banned you from the room or even warned away from it, so you shouldn&#39;t get in trouble or anything. Still the feeling was creeping up on you even now. Best to find a spot and get comfy before your nerve broke and you looked elsewhere.

Unfortunately your lack of familiarity with the room meant that you actually didn&#39;t know what a good hiding spot would be.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;Fifty-one, fifty-two.&quot;@@

You were running out of time and Kara would be on the hunt any moment. In a panic you dove under the bed getting yourself deep enough under that you couldn&#39;t be spotted easily. Didn&#39;t mean Kara wouldn&#39;t check underneath, but it&#39;d be some work at least.

...

As you waited you realized you weren&#39;t the only thing under the bed. There was a cardboard box, not far from your left hand. &lt;&lt;if $traitCatgirl &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;With your catlike eyes you were able to get a decent look, but you couldn&#39;t see inside it yet. Though the lid was already ajar.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;It was too dark to properly make out what was in it, but the lid was already ajar.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; There was nothing else to do, maybe you could just...take a peek.

It looked liked...baby clothes? In the dim you were able to make out their pink tint. For a girl then? You say they were Emily&#39;s, but most of Emily&#39;s baby clothes were actually still in her closet, so why were these here? &lt;&lt;if $traitCatgirl&gt;&gt;Your @@.girlVoice;feline@@ eyes let you see everything clearly. The clothes were oddly dated, which confirmed weren&#39;t Emily&#39;s at all. So who&#39;s were they?&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You searched the box for more clues. There were some other knick-knacks in there, a rattle, pacifier, a book. It looked like it was all ready for a newborn baby girl, but why was it all here?

Your hand wrapped around something, and you pulled it out to get a better look. It looked like a small wooden stick, but having grown up with witches, you knew it was actually a wand. &lt;&lt;if $getEvenBreakResult&gt;&gt;Though this one didn&#39;t seem to have any of the charge that Emily&#39;s did.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;This one seemed to be inert, you couldn&#39;t feel any energy from it.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

On further consideration you probably shouldn&#39;t leave the box open like this, mom got mad if you messed with her stuff. Doing your best to restore the items inside to their proper place you put the lid back on. Once again left under the bed in the dim with nothing to do. A bed that clearly no one had cleaned under in a while. There was an annoying number of dust bunnies around. You took a few moments doing your best to collect them, but with just your hands it was a mostly futile task.

You didn&#39;t hear Kara anywhere nearby, so you probably had a few moments before she came in here. Maybe you could get yourself out from under the bed and find something to properly collect these.

You stalked around the room, getting the lay of the land. You knew your mom wasn&#39;t the most fastidious when it came to cleanliness, but her room was worse than you&#39;d expected.

There was still no sign of your hunter, and you were bored enough that you were actually considering doing a little cleaning while you waited. Was it really a good idea though? What should you do?

Though looking around it seemed any &#39;start&#39; she&#39;d made had been little more than wishful thinking.

You rolled up your metaphorical sleeves and got to work. There was a lot of surface area in this room so it was going to take some focused work to actually clean things properly. Though a proper cleaning did sound like a lot of work, maybe you could just give everything a quick pass and then get back to the game.

Though dusting was the kind of job you had to do again and again anyway, not like you could do it once and call it done.

Considerations about a cleaning schedule bounced around your head as you continued to clean the room. There was a catharsis to actually making things cleaner. The dust bunnies under the bed were still bothering you, but at least you were making progress. There had to be a dustpan somewhere in this house, after the game you could go and find one to finish that particular job.

Her bed wasn&#39;t even made properly. Sure she&#39;d pulled the blanket up over it, but it wasn&#39;t tucked in at the corners, and you really should fold it back down on the top to make it look nice.

You sighed and got to work. Wasn&#39;t this supposed to be your mom&#39;s job? You had to keep your own room clean, not that you ever did a good job, so shouldn&#39;t she be doing her own room? Practice what you preach and all that. Though you had to admit that even in this state it was a lot tidier than yours was. After you finished in here you should probably pop over to your room and take care of it.

There was a lot to finish in this room though, and that wasn&#39;t even getting into the possibility that things inside the drawers or in the closet weren&#39;t organized. That was going to mean even more time spent to get it into respectable shape.

You started, did you have that kind of time? You glanced at the door. Kara could be here at any moment, and you weren&#39;t exactly in a position that concealed your position.

	You tried to suppress it, but you were far too late, letting out a painfully obvious sneeze. Kara would have to be deaf to miss that one, and she wasn&#39;t. She got down onto her hands and knees so she could see under the bed, easily spotting your prone form.

	@@.karaVoice;&quot;Got you,&quot;@@ she stated flatly.

	You cursed under your breath, you probably would have gotten away with this except for that stupid random sneeze. It had basically been self sabotage on that one.

For a while it seemed that you&#39;d made a good pick. You heard Miki wandering around, but nowhere near you...though you heard a lot of footsteps.

As you crossed the threshold to the basement you had an idea. At the bottom of the stairs there was a light switch. If you flipped it off then Sophie might not even realize that you&#39;d come down here. Of course you&#39;d have to find a hiding place in an almost pitch black basement&lt;&lt;if $traitAfraidOfTheDark&gt;&gt;...and that was @@.girlVoice;a super scary@@ idea&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.

Your basement wasn&#39;t scary in general, but with all the lights out...it would be @@.girlVoice;awfully scary@@. But if you didn&#39;t do it then Sophie would know you came down here and you weren&#39;t sure you&#39;d be able to find a good enough spot to fool her.

So you took one last look at the room, planning your path, memorizing it so you could navigate it in the dark. Gathering your courage you flicked off the lights.

...

The basement was pitch black. Without your sight your other senses heightened. You were more concious of the fact it was a little cooler down here, like some dark cave in the wilderness. 

Then there were the sounds. The near silence of the room made every sound stand out that much more. You recognized the hum of the air conditioner, but the other sounds were less familiar. There was creaking from above you. You looked towards it, but couldn&#39;t see anything in the dark. It sounded heavy, like some fearsome beast stalking it&#39;s prey.

Then one of the noises started getting closer...and closer...and closer...

[[It stopped above your head|Hide and Seek Hider Sophie Basement Afraid of the Dark 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="270" name="Hide and Seek Hider Sophie Basement Afraid of the Dark 2" tags="" position="1225,3350" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Ahhhhh!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You @@.girlVoice;squealed@@, fumbling around in the darkness for the light switch. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 12&gt;&gt;Whatever it was was right on top of you.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;The @@.girlVoice;monster@@ had to be right on top of you.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Your @@.girlVoice;panic@@ made your movements more awkward, flailing away at the light switch as your @@.girlVoice;terror@@ grew.

Flicking it on you came face to face with...nothing. 

Looking around made it clear there was nothing else down here but you. Now, in the light, it was obvious what the noise had been. It&#39;d just been the other girls wandering around trying to find their own hiding spots. Everything had just seemed @@.girlVoice;so much scarier@@ in the dark.

But all of this had wasted more time, you&#39;d never be able to make it back upstairs to a different spot. You had to find somewhere to hide down here, even if it was in the light and Sophie had no doubt heard your @@.girlVoice;scream@@ and would know you were down here.

Unfortunately your fall had made you completely lose where you were again. You weren&#39;t even sure what direction you were facing. You moved in a direction, only to bump into a wall...except you didn&#39;t know which wall this was. You tried moving along it, but then you bumped into something...maybe a couch? If it was then you were on the entirely wrong side of the room from where you were tried to go.

You turned yourself in the proper direction...or at least what you thought was the proper direction.

You nodded but tried to get her to quiet down, it wouldn&#39;t work if she gave you away. A problem that doubled itself when Miki joined the pair of you.

This was a dangerous situation, could you really trust Miki and Kara to keep your secret? Or was it better to migrate somewhere else to avoid Sophie?

Emily simply rolled her eyes and sighed, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;always so boring...Come on Miki, you can try first instead.&quot;@@

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Go!&quot;@@

The two of them started the rings spinning. Kara and Sophie watching to keep count of each revolution.

Miki was clearly struggling more than Emily, it was only a few rotations before her ring clattered to the ground. She wasn&#39;t deterred, picking it back up and starting her second attempt.

Meanwhile Emily was still going strong, the pink ring going round and round as if it wasn&#39;t any effort at all. Round and round...@@.girlVoice;round and round@@...@@.girlVoice;round and round@@...you found your attention slowly scoping down onto the ring.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine. I just...zoned out a bit,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you mumbled as you tried to clear your head.

Sophie shrugged in response and went back to counting for the other girls. In the end Emily was the victor by a wide margin, but Miki was still smiling. The two of them came over to join you as Sophie and Kara got ready for their turn.

The sound managed to permeate your mind and though your eyes were still on the hoop your body started to move.

Emily screamed theatrically as she fell. Contorted as you were you didn&#39;t actually see what had managed to put her over the edge. Though looking at Sophie&#39;s grin it seemed there may have been some shenanigans at play.

But her malicious actions came back to haunt her. She squealed as her hand slipped and she thudded against the ground. @@.sophieVoice;&quot;Darn! Why was that spot so slippery.&quot;@@

With that you were the only one left on the mat.

The others would be joining you soon enough, but for now it was just the shame of being the first out.

It was mean to think so but you weren&#39;t surprised when Kara was the first one to fall. Sliding her away off the mat and making her way over to sit with you. She sat down in a huff, clearly not happy with the situation. This whole Olympics competition hadn&#39;t gone well for her. She was being routinely outdone by Emily and Sophie, but even Miki had beaten her a couple times. That had to be both frustrating and embarrassing. Sitting here after being knocked out first you could kind of understand the feeling.

	The two of you sat in silence as the game continued. Nothing but the sound of your mothers&#39;s voice calling out instructions. 
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

After a while Miki was the next one out, unable to reach her leg out far enough to stay stable in an odd position. She fell kinda hard, making Kara lean forward, ready to rush to her aid. However Miki bounced right back up as if nothing had happened. Skipping over to the pair of you and sitting down.

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	Miki and Kara chatted away as game continued. Despite your lack of interest in talking with little girls, you did feel a little left out. It was awkward to sit there silently while the other two were so close by. You hoped the game would be over soon.
	&lt;&lt;changeEmbarassment &quot;small&quot;&gt;&gt;\

The finals between Sophie and Emily went on for quite some time. Both of them had great flexibility and balance so they were able to contort themselves into all manner of positions. It seemed like they might have to call it a draw if this kept up. You couldn&#39;t see any reason why either of them would ever fall other than through fatigue, and no one wanted to wait that long.

It seemed that Emily agreed. After a &#39;right hand red&#39; she reached out before theatrically losing her balance and gently bumping into the ground.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Oh no! I guess you win Sophie!&quot;@@ Emily giggled as she got up from her &#39;fall&#39;.

Arms snaked under legs and legs overtop of people&#39;s heads. All in all, a rather normal game of Twister just amped up by the overfull board.

@@.momVoice;&quot;&#39;Left Foot Blue&#39;&quot;@@

That instruction was going to be awfully tricky, you had other limbs locked in ways that restricted motion, plus all the close circles were taken. You stretched out your foot...just a little further and you&#39;d be able to...your toe touched it and you rejoiced. But the moment you tried to put any weight on it everything went wrong. 

You weren&#39;t actually sure if you were the one that fell first, or one of the girls had dragged you down. Regardless, the tangle of limbs meant that when one of you went down it was going to bring down the whole group.

Which is where the real problem started. Packed as tightly as you were you&#39;d ended up with arms and legs splayed out everywhere. It wasn&#39;t like one of you was on top and could get off first, it was some latticework where everyone was partially both over and under someone else. &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &gt; 12&gt;&gt;Luckily you were near the bottom so you didn&#39;t end up crushing anyone. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Everyone began their attempts to get up. The first couple attempts went nowhere, Sophie tried to rise, but so did Kara, which ended up aborting both their attempts. Miki just failed outright and ended up thudding into you. You tried but you were basically buried under all of them. The next couple attempts went no better. 

As Emily fell back down she started @@.girlVoice;giggling@@ uncontrollably, the absurdity of all of you falling was [[just too funny|Twister Critical Fail 2]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="346" name="Twister Critical Fail 2" tags="" position="725,4350" size="100,100">@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Why are you laughing?

It wasn&#39;t a good joke, you weren&#39;t even sure it was a joke at all, but it was enough to start the entire group @@.girlVoice;giggling away@@. Everyone had given up on trying to rise, too busy laughing at themselves. You could feel your own laugh building in your throat.

Kara&#39;s comment set off a very dangerous moment. Among a tangle of limbs there was a lot of exposed skin, and it was nearly impossible to defend yourself. Even worse you wouldn&#39;t even be able to tell who was doing the tickling, it would be the perfect crime. The scramble which ensued was a chaos of @@.girlVoice;tickling@@ and @@.girlVoice;giggling@@ from which no one was spared.

This patter went on for some time. Emily had been right about being able to fit them all comfortably. Emily and Sophie had crazy flexibility and Kara and Miki were small enough to go under them.

The tale began as the &#39;&#39;left hand&#39;&#39; of the &#39;&#39;green&#39;&#39; knight drew his mighty sword. He&#39;d rode long and hard in order to slay the &#39;&#39;right hand&#39;&#39; of the &#39;&#39;red&#39;&#39; queen. At her &#39;&#39;left hand&#39;&#39; sat the mysterious &#39;&#39;blue&#39;&#39; lady. His &#39;&#39;right foot&#39;&#39; crunched onto the gravel, the &#39;&#39;green&#39;&#39; knight moved carefully. In truth he would give his &#39;&#39;right hand&#39;&#39; in order to save the princess in &#39;&#39;yellow&#39;&#39;. 

His &#39;&#39;left foot&#39;&#39; stomped on a dry twig, alerting the dread wolves who roamed this forest. Their &#39;&#39;red&#39;&#39; eyes boring into him. Perhaps his offer of his &#39;&#39;right hand&#39;&#39; would be taken, as the ground was stained &#39;&#39;red&#39;&#39; with blood. Meanwhile the princess&#39; &#39;&#39;right hand&#39;&#39; twirled a lock of her &#39;&#39;yellow&#39;&#39; hair. She was a fair maiden of only $playerAge, when would her knight save her? Instead she was stuck here under the cruel &#39;&#39;left hand&#39;&#39; of the &#39;&#39;blue&#39;&#39; lady.

Emily was such a brat and totally tried to knock me over, Sophie was teasing me to but I won so I guess I&#39;m the best. I only stuck my tonge out at them a little bit, they totally deserve it though, I bet Sophie was suuuper mad about losing she&#39;s super compeditive.\

&lt;&lt;switch $twisterActivityResult&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;\
	I had no interest in playing Twister, that&#39;s such a kids game, once you get big it totally doesn&#39;t work anymore. So I called instead, the whole @@.strikethrough;&#39;red foot blue&#39;@@ &#39;right foot blue&#39;, &#39;left foot red&#39; thing. It was super boring, I thought I was gonna fall asleep. Ended up day dreaming about some crazy fantasy stuff, like princes and princesses and all that. Way more fun than &#39;right hand yellow&#39;, but aren&#39;t I a little old to be dreaming of princesses and unicorns?\
&lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;\
	Oh my God, Twister totally blew up. I dunno who fell first but the whole group ended up tangled up on the floor. It was soooo funny watching everyone flail around like that but then someone started tickling and it just got super messy. All the girls were giggling, I mean so was I but duh, I was being @@.strikethrough;ticked@@ tickled. Anyway it ended up being pretty fun, though we never did figure out who won.\
&lt;&lt;case 3&gt;&gt;\
	So I kinda suck at Twister. I got knocked out first. &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;I thought being bigger might help with the long limbs and stuff but apparrently not.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I&#39;m totally blaming the fact that I dunno how to deal with being so dang small.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;if $twisterTalkToMiki + $twisterTalkToKara === 0&gt;&gt;\

	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		&lt;&lt;if $twisterTalkToKara&gt;&gt;Kara lost next and she felt really crappy about it, I talked to her some to make her feel better though it only worked cause I&#39;d lost worse.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $twisterTalkToMiki&gt;&gt;Okay sometimes Miki is pretty cute. When she got knocked out she was all worried that I felt bad about losing. Super sweet, actually kinda made me feel better.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; \
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	In the end Sophie won, though Emily was such a drama queen when she lost that I&#39;m pretty sure she just gave up.\
&lt;&lt;case 4&gt;&gt;\
	So it turns out I&#39;m super good at Twister? I don&#39;t really get it but I actually totally won. Like it wasn&#39;t easy, Emily and Sophie were so trying to trip me and Miki and Kara were trying super hard to but I still won which made it way more fun than it would have been otherwise.\

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;switch $twisterActivityResult&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;case 1&gt;&gt;\
	I refused to play Twister, so I ended up calling out instructions instead. The whole thing was pretty boring and I ended up daydreaming to entertain myself. Something about the monotony of the words just lured me half to sleep. Unconsciously it ended up about princes and princesses and unicorns and witches and pretty jewels...uh anyway, Sophie won.\
&lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;\
	The Twister competition was a total disaster. Somebody fell, no one is quite sure who, and brought it down the entire group. The girls were just giggling about the whole thing. It even started an entire tickle fight which I couldn&#39;t escape from. Embarrassingly even I ended up joining in their girlish laughter. I was being tickled, of course I laughed, what else would you expect? Regardless in the game there were no @@.strikethrough;survivors@@ winners.\
&lt;&lt;case 3&gt;&gt;\
	Apparently I&#39;m not the best at Twister. I got knocked out first. &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;I&#39;d blame being bigger than them, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s an advantage or a disadvantage.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I was even the same size as them, maybe I&#39;m just not used to my new reduced height.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;if $twisterTalkToMiki + $twisterTalkToKara === 0&gt;&gt;\

	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		&lt;&lt;if $twisterTalkToKara&gt;&gt;I ended up talking to Kara. She was pretty broken up about losing, but I was able to cheer her up a little bit.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $twisterTalkToMiki&gt;&gt;When Miki got knocked out she actually tried to comfort me about losing so early. It was rather sweet of her and actually did take off some of the sting.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; \
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
	In the end Sophie knocked out Emily, though I&#39;m pretty sure Emily just got bored and gave up.\
&lt;&lt;case 4&gt;&gt;\
	Though it was a surprise to everyone, including me, I was able to pull out a win in Twister. However it wasn&#39;t without difficulty. Emily and Sophie tried to sabotage my attempts. Miki and Kara behaved, but Miki was so small she kept sneaking under me. Regardless I think they at least had some fun.\

	//Bugs? Really? That&#39;s it?//

	It was no wonder that she&#39;d been loath to admit that fear. It was so stereotypically girly and clashed with her normally self-assured aura. It was hard to imagine her screeching and running away from a spider or a cockroach. You&#39;d really be able to tease her about this one.

In the rare occasions she had been left alone she was always clingy when mom came back, but you&#39;d never connected it to a tangible fear.

&lt;&lt;if $traitMonophobia&gt;&gt;\
	A fear that you totally shared. At first being alone just sucked, but after a little bit it got worse. It only took one thing, a strange sound, catching something out of the corner of your eye, or even an errant thought. Anything that made you feel @@.girlVoice;terror@@ for even a moment.

	Once that happened it all spiralled out of control. With no one there to calm you down after that moment it just kept weighing on you. Now every sound and sight was another potential danger, adding to the anxiety. Making you keenly aware of just how @@.girlVoice;alone@@ and @@.girlVoice;vulnerable@@ you were. If something happened to you, there would be no one to help. No one would even know that anything had happened.

	That&#39;s why you much preferred staying with the crowd. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 12&gt;&gt;The girls luckily made that quite easy.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Even if that crowd was a bunch of little girls.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

	@@.emilyVoice;&quot;I get scared something bad might happen...You&#39;re all by yourself and if something happens there is no one to help.&quot;@@

	This was different from Sophie&#39;s and Kara&#39;s fear. Theirs was a keen instant fear, a reaction to an immediate &#39;threat&#39;. Emily&#39;s fear was something slower and more insidious. There was no specific stimulus; instead her own imagination would provide endless horrors to worry her. Like if someone broke in, or she got into an accident, or a fire started...

	That shook you. Emily was a bonafide witch, she could handle //way// more than any eight year old should, probably more than most adults.

			&lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;\
				I told her I didn&#39;t want to look stupid. Apparently Sophie and the rest of the girls took this to mean I was scared of it.

I can&#39;t exactly tease them if I feel the same.\

The crash course in girly &#39;sports&#39; that followed was actually pretty fun. The only issue was that I got so comfortable with them I sort of dropped my filter. I just started asking anything that came to mind, even if it was a dumb question. I just felt like I wanted to talk all the time. At least they were nice about it, even when I was struggling to understand some instructions.\
			&lt;&lt;case 4&gt;&gt;\
				I told her that I didn&#39;t want to play because they were boring games for little girls. Suspiciously she actually seemed to take this answer pretty well. I don&#39;t actually know what happened next, the memories are all fuzzy. My brain just seems to fog over whenever I think about it.

	&lt;&lt;case 2&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;\
You goggled. What in the world was Emily talking about? They were kids! Why would they even know about something like Spin the Bottle?
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
Spin the Bottle? You had some vague recollection of that game, it didn&#39;t seem like something that would be appropriate for you all.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

A few moments later the truth was revealed. There was a bottle to spin, but it was a clear nail polish bottle. The game had nothing to do with&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 8&gt;&gt; @@.girlVoice;gross@@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; kissing. It had everything to do with painting your nails a variety of &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 14&gt;&gt;sickeningly @@.girlVoice;girly@@&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 11&gt;&gt;@@.girlVoice;girly@@&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;@@.girlVoice;cute@@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; colors.

It wasn&#39;t even just straight forward spin the bottle and paint a color. There was a board with all sorts of minor variations. Painting someone else&#39;s nail, painting two the same color, painting one in two colors. You wouldn&#39;t say that it was complicated, but it was a little more involved than you had expected. You supposed it would be more fun than just &#39;pick a color, use it&#39;.

Emily was placing out a variety polish bottles. All of them bright, @@.girlVoice;girly@@ and many of them sparkly. @@.emilyVoice;&quot;Done. Time to play.&quot;@@

	You were @@.girlVoice;excited@@, there were so many @@.girlVoice;pretty colors@@ to choose from. You just had to hope you&#39;d get nice ones and the girl&#39;s wouldn&#39;t sabotage you too much.

You bit the bullet and sat down. Taking your place in the circle.

You took a moment to get a better look at the situation. There were a dizzying array of nail polish colors around the board: Pink, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple, Orange...and that didn&#39;t get into all the variants that were @@.girlVoice;glittery@@. The board itself only had six, but it seemed Emily was taking &quot;Switch all the polishes around&quot; to mean bringing in an entirely new set.

Well at least there would be lots of colors to choose from...well, to randomly be selected. There was exactly one spot where you actually would get to pick a color to paint on your own nails. Most of the time others in the group would get to choose. The girls would probably have fun regardless of the chosen color though.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;The rules are simple, spin the bottle, do what it says. We&#39;ll go in a circle starting with Kara.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;set $rightIndexFingernailColor to _sophieChosenColor + &#39;Nail&#39;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/silently&gt;&gt;\
Kara going first meant that you were going to end up going last. Though you doubted order mattered, everyone was going to end up with every nail painted. This wasn&#39;t really a &quot;game&quot; in a traditional sense, it was just some nonsense to make it more fun. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 10&gt;&gt;Sure you wanted your nails painted, but this seemed an awfully roundabout way of doing things.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Though you were struggling to see the appeal of the complexity. However the girls seemed to already be excited.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

So you watched as the game began. Kara painted one of Miki&#39;s nails pink, Miki shakily painted one of Kara&#39;s green, Emily painted her thumb a split red/blue. Thus far you&#39;d entirely avoided attention, but it wasn&#39;t to last.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
Holding it up you could see she had done an excellent job. She grinned at you. Seemed like she was going to play nice for now.

Emily giggled at your momentary reverie which was enough to bring you back to reality. You spun and landed on...

&quot;Paint 1 nail on the person to the right.&quot;

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
Sophie examined the nail; her distaste was obvious, it was a pretty sloppy job after all. However, this didn&#39;t seem to bother her as much as you would have suspected.

After a few more turns you had a trio of your own nails in the new glossy colors. They didn&#39;t really match your other nails, but &#39;matching&#39; wasn&#39;t the goal here, it was just having some fun.

Fun that you thought would be delayed when you landed on &#39;Lose a Turn&#39;, but Emily had other ideas.

Emily apparently had a rather complicated plan for the simple task of getting everyone&#39;s nails painted. Instead of just picking a color and everyone getting to work, there was an entire Spin The Bottle-esque game. In the end the only real change was that instead of having a single color everyone ended up with a mishmash of random rainbow colors and patterns.&lt;&lt;if $paintingNailsActivityResult === 2&gt;&gt;I didn&#39;t want such a sloppy set of nails so I asked for them to be removed.

Quickly enough Emily was into the rhythm and easily skipping with the ropes, hopping on two feet.

@@.musicalNoteEmoji;🎵@@Butterfly, Butterfly@@.musicalNoteEmoji;🎵@@ 

The girls began to rhyme as the ropes continued their pace. Emily started hopping on one foot. Working hard to keep up with the tempo.

@@.musicalNoteEmoji;🎵@@Butterfly, Butterfly, throws a kiss, kiss, kiss@@.musicalNoteEmoji;🎵@@

The ropes sped up and became a blur. Emily was forced to alter her skipping style. Though to you it looked more like she was running in place rather than jumping. It was actually moving way faster than you expected, it was an impressive feat of coordination. 

@@.musicalNoteEmoji;🎵@@Butterfly, Butterfly, get out before you miss, miss, miss@@.musicalNoteEmoji;🎵@@

The tempo changed and Emily started jumping with two feet again. You weren&#39;t sure what the difference was between this and how it had started. Though when you looked closed you realized that she was jumping high enough to let both ropes pass beneath her on each revolution.

@@.musicalNoteEmoji;🎵@@Butterfly, Butterfly@@.musicalNoteEmoji;🎵@@

She continued hopping on two feet but then she suddenly pitched forward half landing on her hands. You realized that she&#39;d placed a rock on the ground between her hops.

	The game started the same as last time. Moving at a fairly casual pace, which Sophie was having no trouble with.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	You started off the game slowly and Miki, on the other side of the ropes, matched your pace. It was supposed to start slowly anyway so it was fine, but it was mostly you trying to get used to the feel of it.

The girls were so fast with these rhymes. Clearly they&#39;d done this enough that they had an entire repertoire of tunes. &lt;&lt;if $skippingActivityResult === 1&gt;&gt;It seemed like it was the responsibility of the ones swinging the ropes to lead the song. Luckily Miki was covering for you and singing extra loud so your quiet wasn&#39;t as obvious. Despite that you tried your best to follow along with the unfamiliar words.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

@@.musicalNoteEmoji;🎵@@Went upstairs to powder her face.@@.musicalNoteEmoji;🎵@@

Sophie had no trouble with the one foot hopping, but the speed section was causing her more difficulty. In the end she managed it, but she looked tired from the experience.

@@.musicalNoteEmoji;🎵@@How many boxes did it take?@@.musicalNoteEmoji;🎵@@

In contrast she seemed much more comfortable with the double unders. Her athleticism meant that consistently jumping high wasn&#39;t too difficult.

	Not knowing much about the show it was a little difficult to follow things. The purple one had a problem fitting in, and wasn&#39;t allowed to use magic.

Being Lady Emily&#39;s familiar hadn&#39;t been the worst experience, but there was too much to look forward to as a human. You took the warm calm of a bath for granted until you had to use your own tongue to get the same result.

As the magic wrapped around you, you took one last stretch, enjoying the obscene flexibility of your feline body. Still, it would be a small price to pay. Already you could see your fur falling out, pink skin starting to show on your paws. Shrinking down had been a harrowing experience that you could scarcely concentrate on, this time you had perfect focus.

It quickly became uncomfortable to stand on all fours so you leaned back onto your haunches...your butt and watched as your claws disappeared. Your increasingly human fingers lengthening and consuming them until there was nothing left but boring, mostly dull, fingernails...toenails you corrected. Human digits were strange and different and it&#39;d taken you a moment to remember how everything connected up.

Things inside you shifted and rearranged, your limbs shooting out to incredible lengths as the rest of your body struggled to keep up. They felt noodly for a moment before everything locked into place and they felt solid and strong. Though strong was a relative term, you felt so damn heavy that a jump would be a pathetic stumpy thing at best.

Still, you were almost back to entirely human. You had fingers and toes and arms and legs and a dozen other things that marked the end of your feline experience. Emily looked on with fascination, curious as to the process.

As you rose you could see the world from an incredible angle, seeing distant objects, unobstructed by things like table legs. Though the couch still nearly matched you in height...was that right?

You woke up with a start, expecting to see the television in front of you, but instead being presented with your @@.girlVoice;boring boy@@ room.

As you roused you noted that not only were you tucked in under the blankets, but you&#39;d also been given a new set of @@.girlVoice;white and pink Hello Kitty jammies@@.

The clock showed that you&#39;d been asleep...for...a long time and you could hear Emily getting ready for school in the next room. 

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Hey there sleepy head,&quot;@@ finished with her setup she&#39;d come to wake you up, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;you fell asleep in front of the TV so mommy had to carry you up. You were so cute.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Cute-nya?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You made a little cat paw pose as you did. 

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Super cute,&quot;@@ Emily confirmed, much to your delight.

@@.girlThought;Everybody likes me if I&#39;m cute.@@

Energized by the compliment you sprang out of bed, running downstairs with her for breakfast. Only to be scolded by mom for running.

[[After breakfast|Get Away Bad End Escape 8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="466" name="Get Away Bad End Escape 8" tags="" position="725,5850" size="100,100">With Emily out of the house it just left you and mom. Since you were six you technically should have been going as well, but you weren&#39;t about to bring up the subject. Maybe the fact you currently had a tail would cause trouble. Anyway, staying home and playing sounded way more fun.

@@.momVoice;&quot;So you&#39;re going to be mommy&#39;s little helper today. Okay?&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Yes mommy!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You beamed.

Though your enthusiasm was dampened when it turned out what you would be helping with was mostly chores. Playing in the yard would be way more fun than helping to fold laundry.

&lt;&lt;if $traitNeat&gt;&gt;\
At least that&#39;s what you&#39;d thought at first. One of the compulsions from the party that had stuck around was a strong desire to be neat. Unfolded laundry was maddening and though the act of folding itself wasn&#39;t particularly interesting, the catharsis of seeing folded laundry made it more than worth it.

With the laundry done you were excited to get to the next cleaning task, and mom was more than happy to provide. You had a pretty big house, so there were lots of things to clean. Plus with mom being so busy and Emily hating cleaning things had somewhat deteriorated. To an undiscerning eye it probably looked fine, but to you even a speck was unacceptable; with your feline eyes you saw every speck.

After the main chores were done you began taking on your own additional tasks. Starting with sweeping and dusting every corner of the house.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
...

Being &quot;mommy&#39;s little helper&quot; was even less fun than you&#39;d feared. Laundry had gave way into dusting into...

...

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Are we done yet?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You @@.girlVoice;whined@@. It felt like you&#39;d been at this forever, it was at least thirty minutes. You just //had// to do something else.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Can I //please// go play outside?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You put as much @@.girlVoice;sweetness@@ into your voice as you could; eyes wide, pleading your case.

@@.momVoice;&quot;I suppose if-&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Yay!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You cut off any possible conditions with a cheer, rushing quickly outside before mom could change her mind.

Any thoughts your mother had about calling you back were forgotten. It was too enjoyable to watch you play. You were a @@.girlVoice;cute little six year old girl@@ to start with. Your @@.girlVoice;feline features@@ and @@.girlVoice;boundless energy@@ had only enhanced your @@.girlVoice;cuteness@@ further.

Using your @@.girlVoice;cuteness@@ to get out of working hadn&#39;t been entirely unintentional. Emily had wormed her way out of trouble by being cute so often that you knew the tricks. Except right now you were @@.girlVoice;even cuter@@ than she was. 

You grinned as you @@.girlVoice;skipped@@ through the yard, you could use this. The fact you&#39;d been a sixteen year old boy a week ago had fled from your mind. Your focus now was on using this @@.girlVoice;cuteness@@ to it&#39;s full potential.

After you were done playing, and mom was done all of the chores, you made a bee line for Emily&#39;s room. The dress you were wearing was @@.girlVoice;pretty cute@@, but you knew you could do better. Emily had lots of @@.girlVoice;cute clothes@@ for her age, but she also had lots of clothes from when she was younger. Outfits that she would no doubt decry as being &quot;babyish&quot;, and refuse to wear ever again. She probably wouldn&#39;t object to you borrowing a couple.

You dug to the back of Emily&#39;s closet where her old clothes would be. There was a shocking amount there, stuff from all the way back to her being a baby. Even the @@.girlVoice;baby clothes@@ were a consideration. Mom&#39;s magic made sure that everything would fit no matter what, and @@.girlVoice;babies were super cute@@. So if you were willing to wear a @@.girlVoice;romper@@, it would fit perfectly. There was one set with a @@.girlVoice;tutu@@ and @@.girlVoice;romper@@ that said @@.girlVoice;princess@@. It was an undeniably @@.girlVoice;adorable@@ outfit, but it was meant for babies. Even if it fit it didn&#39;t seem quite right, on a girl your age. You didn&#39;t look like a baby so you couldn&#39;t be @@.girlVoice;cute@@ like a baby. You needed something that suited you.

However, even the @@.girlVoice;toddler clothes@@ deserved a proper look. Toddlers were @@.girlVoice;super cute@@ as well, and you weren&#39;t much bigger than one anyway. Sure it would make you look @@.girlVoice;younger@@ than you already were, but that was fine as long as it made you @@.girlVoice;cuter@@. There was Emily&#39;s first @@.girlVoice;ballet outfit@@, though it looked more like a costume.

You continued to dig through the pile. Setting aside anything you deemed sufficiently @@.girlVoice;adorable@@ for your purposes. More @@.girlVoice;dresses@@, a @@.girlVoice;Minnie costume@@, a set of @@.girlVoice;Hello Kitty overalls@@. Quickly you&#39;d gone from having not enough possibilities to having far too many. How were you every going to be able to pick?

The obvious answer was, of course, that you didn&#39;t have to. It wasn&#39;t like today was your only opportunity. Plus cuteness was in the eye of the beholder. Just because you thought an outfit was the @@.girlVoice;prettiest@@ didn&#39;t mean everyone else would. It was vitally important that everyone else thought you @@.girlVoice;cute@@ as well.

So you grabbed an outfit. Putting the rest back in, set into a pile so they&#39;d be easier to access in the future. Adapting one of Emily&#39;s hair bows into a tail bow.
&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/GetAway/EmilyCloset7.webp&#39; &quot;smallMiddleLeft&quot;&gt;&gt;\

You spent the next few days perfecting your craft. Figuring out which words worked best, which outfits looked @@.girlVoice;cutest@@, what poses looked the most @@.girlVoice;innocent@@. Once you even managed to get Emily into trouble instead of you, much to her annoyance. She&#39;d wanted a @@.girlVoice;little sister@@, but she&#39;d never considered the implicit responsibilty of being a big sister.

No doubt mom would catch on eventually. Realizing that your @@.girlVoice;wide eyed@@ look was more calculated than it seemed. At that point she&#39;d probably transform you back. Pouting as a teenager would be much less effective. 

But until then you&#39;d focus on being the @@.girlVoice;cutest little catgirl@@ in the world, and make sure everyone knew it.

The next morning started much the same as the last. Emily came in as you were waking up, you waved to her as she went to school, and then you went to help mom. There was a bunch left to do from yesterday and cleaning was a job that was never done.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Before you start, Kara brought me something this morning.&quot;@@ Mom&#39;s voice was odd, as if even she was at a bit of a loss.

She went to the closet and pulled something out. At first you just thought it was a @@.girlVoice;black and white dress@@ but there was more to it than that.

It ended up being a very short visit. Kara spotted you in the outfit, made a high pitched noise and ran off again. This time she didn&#39;t even take the time to say goodbye to Emily.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Kara is weird.&quot;@@ Emily stated flatly, drawing nods from the rest of you.

This pattern repeated itself a few more nights before Kara was finally able to stand in your presence. You&#39;d grown awfully self conscious about the situation. Mom said it wasn&#39;t anything you were doing, that Kara was the one being skittish, but you still worried it was your fault.

Kara approached you cautiously, as if you might bite. Admittedly you did have sharp teeth, but you&#39;d never bite.

You gave a tiny nod, though she was already basically touching them before you&#39;d agreed. As promised she was very gentle, it even felt nice, as odd as the situation was.

After a few more minutes of examination and squealing and babbling Kara finally calmed down enough to be questioned about why she was freaking out so badly.

It wasn&#39;t clear if she&#39;d done this all solo, or had assistance, regardless she&#39;d stayed up all night to make sure it was //perfect// before giving it to your mother. She had to hand it off like that as she was too shy to do it herself.

With the explanation complete your mother burst out laughing. You rarely saw her that full of mirth, but it brought a smile to your face. She put her hand on Kara&#39;s head, @@.momVoice;&quot;you are a very unique girl.&quot;@@ It was meant as a compliment...probably.

You wouldn&#39;t have minded. She was fun to play with, and she kept bringing you new @@.girlVoice;cute outfits@@. It turned out that she had more than a passing interest in cosplay, and a good number of costumes to her name. The two of you were close to the same size, so it was only a few minor alterations to size things properly. Thus her cosplay costumes became your everyday garb. Though you had to admit that the maid outfit was still your favorite. You spent so much of your time cleaning it was nice to have an outfit that matched the theme.

In all of this one important thing had been forgotten by all the parties involved...turning you back. You certainly weren&#39;t about to say anything, you were having the time of your life. Emily loved having a cute little sister and Kara &#39;&#39;loved&#39;&#39; how you were now. Which only left mom as someone who could remember to put a stop to it. Except you were being such a help around the house that her mind had drifted off to other concerns.

One day someone would remember and put you back into your &quot;proper&quot; sixteen year old body, but until then you would spend every moment enjoying yourself. Which was to say, most of your time would be spent cleaning, because you didn&#39;t enjoy anything more than that. Other people probably would find it weird, but who were they to say what is normal for a former sixteen year old boy turned into a six year old catgirl.

If you spent another minute here there was no telling what else was going to happen to your mind and body. Yes, the first time you tried to escape you&#39;d ended up with cat ears and famgs, but that was almost tolerable. There was no way mom had actually set it up to turn you into an actual cat. You&#39;d probably already triggered that particular trap and would be able to just walk out scot free. Where you would go for the rest of the day was an open question, you couldn&#39;t exactly be too public considering how you currently looked.

Taking a moment where Emily wasn&#39;t paying attention you snuck your way towards the door. Your hand was almost on the door when Emily caught you and called out.

Emily relaxed as you sheepishly walked back to the rest of the group. You felt a little better as well. It wasn&#39;t total relaxation, but you&#39;d be able to tolerate the party. At least for a little longer.

Spots of light started flashing in front of your eyes, and your vision wobbled, trying to make sense of a sudden rush of contradictory signals. You looked down at your hand, still gripping onto the door, and saw it changing. Your hand was already smaller than it&#39;d been to start the day, but now it was shrinking even further. That perhaps wasn&#39;t entirely surprising, most of this party was trying to make you smaller. However, the &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &lt;= 10&gt;&gt;yellow&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;brown&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; hair that was sprouting from the back of your hand was more novel.

//No, not hair. Fur.//

Your attention stayed focused on your hand, fascinated by the rapidly spreading fur. Though from the itching building on your chest, it wasn&#39;t just your hand that was getting fuzzier. 

Your whole body was getting smaller by the moment. &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &lt;= 8&gt;&gt;With as short as you&#39;d become in a few more moments you might not even be able to reach the handle at all.&lt;&lt;elseif $playerAge &lt;= 14&gt;&gt;You&#39;d already lost significant height at this party, and this shrinking showed no signs of stopping.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;In a flash you&#39;d lost over a foot of height, and your shrinking showed no signs of stopping.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You grit your sharp teeth against the continued sensations.

It was getting harder and harder to get your fingers to wrap around the knob. Not only did they feel increasingly stiff, but they were getting shorter as well.

A quick glance to your other hand showed the same, the fur crawling onto your palms. There were some spots that were uncovered, but the skin there was turning an unnatural pink.

Your &quot;hand&quot; on the door was barely holding on, merely resting on the top of the knob. You couldn&#39;t even move your thumb, it was stuck to the finger next to it. Your feet felt even stranger, and an attempt to wiggle your &quot;toes&quot; resulted in four movements in response, not five.

This was far more intense than it had been before. The first time had been a warning, but this might be the real deal. If you kept holding on you might really get turned into a cat, or perhaps this was all just a bluff and the magic would cut out any second.

Getting yourself free while your digits were something that could could charitably be called &quot;humanoid&quot;. 

//I don&#39;t wanna be a cat.//

However, the charge began to fade to a background buzz, disappearing entirely only a few moments later. With its disappearance your body seemed to be settling itself back into a more normal form. Though &quot;normal&quot; was a relative term at this point.

Once again able to focus on non paw related matters, you realized that the other girls had been watching the entire incident. The looks on their faces were impossible to decipher, something between disappointed, fascinated, and amused. Except for Emily, she just looked annoyed. Glaring at you, hands on her hips.

//What is Sophie talking about?//

Your tail twitched in frustration.

Wait.

What.

TAIL!?!

Whipping around you grabbed at the offending appendage, drawing a wince from you. 

//I guess that confirms it&#39;s attached.//

You held onto the tail, staring at it as if you could will it away. It stubbornly refused to disappear. It would obey instructions to move, but not to go away. Though the sensation of telling a tail to move was an entirely alien experience.

Emboldened by your logic you grabbed at the door with your other &quot;hand&quot;, though that term was becoming more inaccurate by the second. With your lack of manual dexterity the best you could manage was to press in from both sides. You couldn&#39;t actually turn the knob this way, but you still felt confident.

A confidence that shattered when your vision dropped several more inches. This wasn&#39;t just getting shorter, your legs felt tremendously unstable. You had to lean into the handle in an attempt to keep upright, but this just intensified the charge.

You @@.girlVoice;hissed@@ at the sensations. They were too strange to be called pain, but they were deeply uncomfortable.

It was a strange thought to cross your mind, though you instinctively knew it to be true. As much as your former hands weren&#39;t suited to turning a doorknob, your legs and former feet weren&#39;t suited to keeping you upright all on their own.

Finally your instability combined with your minuscule stature was too much and you lost your grip on the door. As you fell you lost focus on the world, the bright spots covering your entire vision until you couldn&#39;t see a thing.

When you finally awoke you felt terrible. It was hard to even get your head off of the pillow it was resting on. Opening your eyes your eyes was a mighty feat all on its own. Even when you finally managed it, it was clear that you hadn&#39;t really woken up properly. Your vision was spotty, sharp in some spots while blurry when you tried to look straight ahead. The colors around you were washed out. Like you knew the couch wasn&#39;t supposed to be that weird washed out brown. 

Even the table legs looked odd, you were staring straight at them, but they just didn&#39;t look normal. You realized the strangeness of the look was because you&#39;d never looked at them from this angle. Generally you&#39;d be looking down at them. Even laying on the floor this was oddly low angle.

Involuntarily you yawned, and at the same time heard a cat yawn, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;mrowwww.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; 

You looked around for the source of the strange sound. Your sharp eyes weren&#39;t able to detect a cat, nor anyone else in the vicinity. But you were //sure// that you&#39;d heard something.

&quot;This is weird,&quot; was what you intended to say, but all you heard was more @@.girlVoice;cat noises@@.

Experimentally you tried to speak again, more @@.girlVoice;cat noises@@. It dawned on you that somehow the noises were coming from you. Though as you finally had the wherewithal to look down at yourself, the reason became apparent.

On the one hand the change to your body was obviously radical. You had paws, were covered in fur and weren&#39;t even a foot long. On the other, by the standards of cats, you were entirely normal. Though as you considered your diminutive size &quot;kitten&quot; would be the more accurate term. Even in this the magic had made sure you&#39;d gotten younger.

As you continued to rouse, getting yourself unsteadily to your feet, that odd calm began to fade, anxieties creeping in. You&#39;d been made into a @@.girlVoice;tiny kitten@@, even standing up you were only a few inches tall. Everything in the living room looked //enormous//. This was a space meant for humans not for @@.girlVoice;pets@@ like you.

Hesitantly you began to crawl out of the blanket that you&#39;d been laying on. Mercifully you&#39;d been granted the instincts to be able to walk on all fours. Though even the blanket was causing you troubles. It kept sinking under your feet...paws...and throwing off your balance. You hadn&#39;t yet grown into &quot;feline grace&quot;, and were still a little unstable.

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;Ah! She&#39;s awake!&quot;@@ A voice boomed from across the room.

Your head snapped in that direction and you saw two massive grey cylinders stretching into the sky. You craned your neck the best you could, eventually sitting down so you could get a better angle to see the giant before you.

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;Oh you&#39;re so cute!&quot;@@ Miki&#39;s voice boomed again. She stomped over to you, her every step vibrating the floor beneath you.

Turning to see one of her arms swinging towards you meant that you couldn&#39;t keep the other in vision.

Miki&#39;s hand scooped under you, lifting you up as if you weighed nothing at all.

This was quite possibly the most terrifying experience in your entire life. You were casually swung into the air. All four of your paws unable to find traction on anything, it felt like you might plummet to the ground at any moment. Consciously you knew you were only a few feet in the air, Miki wasn&#39;t that tall, but in your current form you might as well be standing at the edge of a skyscraper. &lt;&lt;if $traitAfraidOfHeights&gt;&gt;Your @@.girlVoice;fear of heights@@ had little to do with this terror.

Though you did get to see some new things. Mom and Emily usually trained in, well it wasn&#39;t quite secret, but it was clear you weren&#39;t invited. Now you got front row seats to Emily&#39;s magical education.

Which was shockingly boring. Emily was still young so it wasn&#39;t like she was learning powerful world altering spells every day. No, she was still learning to properly control her magic, as well as the principles of magic itself. It was pretty boring, but you wanted to stay near Emily.

Ever since your transformation you were uncomfortable whenever Emily was out of earshot. You slept through most of the day just so you could avoid the feeling while Emily was at school. You&#39;d wanted to go along with her, but mom had shot that idea down. She wasn&#39;t going to explain to the teacher why Emily had a cat in her backpack.

When she was home you followed Emily everywhere. Underneath the table at dinner, sitting on a chair when she had homework to do, curled up on the end of the bed while she slept. You were &#39;&#39;compelled&#39;&#39; to stay with her. It&#39;d only been a couple days and you felt closer than ever to her.

You snapped awake, looking towards Emily, you could see her from here, but she was nose down in a book, she hadn&#39;t even turned. You began moving towards her.

&lt;span class=&quot;emilyVoice italics&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re just so cute.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Still she hadn&#39;t turned, but the voice sounded crystal clear.

&lt;span class=&quot;emilyVoice italics&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to stay a kitty cat?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

By now you&#39;d managed to circle around in front of her only to see something shocking. Her lips weren&#39;t moving.

&lt;span class=&quot;emilyVoice italics&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t look so surprised, you&#39;re my familiar, I don&#39;t need to talk for you to hear me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; She closed the book but her lips stayed firmly shut. &lt;span class=&quot;emilyVoice italics&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m speaking into your mind.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

Emily explained that witches and their familiars were mentally linked. As long as the two of you were close enough you could communicate telepathically. Not only that, but Emily would actually be able to see through your eyes, though she needed a little more time to figure that one out.

This was a mercy. Once again you had a way to communicate with more than @@.girlVoice;incomprehensible meowing@@. Though it did have one major drawback, Emily had to act as your translator. And her translations weren&#39;t always faithful.

Mom had said that it would take some time for the magic to work its way out of your body. But how long was that? You&#39;d thought it&#39;d be a few days, but it&#39;d already been almost a week, what if it was going to be weeks? Or even months? Then again, you were actually enjoying your time with Emily, as strange as it was. It was pretty awesome to be able to take naps whenever you wanted. Head scratches were always a joy and Emily was a good mistr...owne...sister. 

A dull ache built in your head. The longer you spent in this form the more you were getting comfortable with the idea of being Emily&#39;s familiar. She wasn&#39;t doing anything to encourage it, but the constant connection to her just reinforced your new relationship dynamic.

Emily could see through your eyes, hear through your ears, but you couldn&#39;t do the opposite. When she cast magic you could feel it moving through you, but you obviously couldn&#39;t do any of your own. She was the one who acted and you were there to support her. She took care of you and you provided some comfort.

You were even reliant on her to communicate any of your needs more complex than hunger. Sometimes she didn&#39;t translate perfectly of course, and at first that had annoyed you, but now....now it felt like perhaps that she just knew better than you did as to what to say. Though her mother was always able to discern the moments where the translations were...looser. Her mother was supernaturally good at knowing if her child was lying, and it had nothing to do with being a witch. It was a normal &quot;mom power&quot;.

When you found yourself once again curled up in her lap about to fall asleep you were struck by a strange idea. It would be so easy to stay this way, wouldn&#39;t it? Mom had said that even when the magic faded she&#39;d still need to cast a reversal. If you just did nothing, and let Emily make the decision then you&#39;d probably just stay a cat. Things were so much easier when you let her make decisions for you...

You leapt off the bed, allowing Lady Emily to properly make her bed.

Calling your former little sister &quot;Lady&quot;, should have been something you&#39;d refused to do. However, when she&#39;d suggested it yesterday, half in jest, it had resonated so strongly in your mind that you couldn&#39;t help yourself. It just felt right to address her that way, she was your master, at least for the moment.

The idea of being on two legs wasn&#39;t as appealing as it sounded. You guessed that if you were turned into a human you&#39;d be perfectly comfortable with it. But right now, on all fours, the idea of being on two legs sounded unstable and dangerous.

//Turned &#39;&#39;back&#39;&#39; into a human,// you corrected mentally. It seemed silly from here, but you were once Lady Emily&#39;s older brother, though you shuddered at memories of your behavior at the time.

She muttered an incantation and a blue bolt emerged from the crystal. To your enhanced perception it seemed to be moving in slow motion. She&#39;d told you to stay put, but it would be so easy just to step out of the way...

...

The next few days were surprisingly unchanged. You&#39;d already been living the life of Lady Emily&#39;s familiar and you just had to continue as you had been.

There were moments of disquiet. When your decision was explained to the rest of the girls there was an uncomfortable amount of attention, but it was tolerable. The contents of your old room being put into storage was unnerving. Though it was from it being an uncomfortable reminder of your old life, not a sense of longing about it. You were a familiar now, why would you worry about human possessions?

[[A witch&#39;s familiar|Get Away Bad End Stay 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="502" name="Get Away Bad End Stay 4" tags="" position="225,6350" size="100,100">As the weeks progressed that mindset continued to solidify in your mind. You were Lady Emily&#39;s familiar and though you were both young, you&#39;d grow together. Though you looked like a normal enough cat there were several important distinctions. One of which being your dramatically lengthened lifespan, so the two of you never had to worry about being apart from one another.

Your mind was quite a bit sharper than your average feline, though nowhere near as sophisticated it had once been. Complex human skills like reading and writing had completely faded away, not that you&#39;d be able to write with paws anyway. Decision making was difficult, it was easier to just let yourself move by instinct, or on the instructions of Lady Emily. She could do all that difficult thinking for you. A familiar didn&#39;t need to understand the underlying mathematics of an arcane circle, they just needed to stand with their master to act as a conduit or a stabilizer. Tasks like that, as complex as they sounded, came to you entirely naturally. The ability was coded into your very being.

Not that you mourned the loss. Your imagination was rather limited now, but you couldn&#39;t imagine a better existence than one as Lady Emily&#39;s familiar. You would be at her side, and she would be at yours and the two of you could accomplish anything...after you finished this nap...

It was only a moment before a black streak leapt out of the tip of her wand. Striking you straight between the eyes and temporarily blinding you.

...

You&#39;d hoped that, once your vision came back, you&#39;d still be in the living room with the girls, but you had no such luck. Once again you found yourself squeezed into an elementary school desk, staring at a blank blackboard. The room looked fairly similar to before, but seemed a little less childish. Everything was still friendly and brightly colored, but gone were the reminders of super basic stuff. Now there were grammar tips and simple math equations. You&#39;d graduated, now you got to sit in Emily&#39;s grade 3 classroom.

One thing that hadn&#39;t changed at all was the mom &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 12&gt;&gt;simulacrum&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;bot&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; standing at the front of the room.

She just kept writing, the mom-bot had a seemingly endless set of these platitudes. As she wrote more it was clear this was a rather old fashioned list. Very much in the &quot;children should be seen and not heard&quot; school of thinking. You doubted this was how your mom actually thought, but it was thematic for this classroom setting.

&lt;span style=&quot;color: lightgray&quot;&gt;\
Good girls are always polite.
Good girls control their emotions.
&lt;/span&gt;\

...

Writing more and more until the entire board was filled with these statements. You cringed at the set. Most of them were reasonable in isolation, but as a group they totalled to an extremely restricted existence.

[[Time to play|Get Mean Ending Participate 7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="518" name="Get Mean Ending Participate 7" tags="" position="975,6475" size="100,100">You and the girls got back to the sleepover. There was still plenty stuff to do and now you were compelled to participate, whether you wanted to or not. Even if you didn&#39;t like an activity you&#39;d had to follow the rules: @@.girlVoice;play nice with others@@, @@.girlVoice;no whining@@, @@.girlVoice;no talking back@@, @@.girlVoice;no being mean@@. 

@@.karaVoice;&quot;$Theyre so well behaved, it&#39;s almost eerie.&quot;@@

The other girls nodded their agreement. You were making Kara look like a rebellious wild child. Sophie was put out because you never rose to any of her bait. No matter how much she teased you, you&#39;d just smile and take it. @@.girlVoice;No making fun of people@@, even if Sophie wasn&#39;t following that rule, you had to.

&lt;&lt;if $playerAge &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;\
Even with your new compulsions the magic of the sleepover continued to do its work. You got @@.girlVoice;younger@@ and @@.girlVoice;girlier@@ until your body matched your behaviour. Interestingly your mind was untouched, it was buried under a mountain of rules, but you were still as intelligent as a $playerMaturity year old.
&lt;&lt;set $playerAge to 8&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
Your total participation seemed to be enough to satisfy the magic of the sleepover. You&#39;d already been the right age and gender, now you had the right behaviour. What else was there to change? &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;Though your more mature mind was actually still intact.

When mom returned home she was given a report that you had behaved exactly as Emily had desired, that you&#39;d become the &quot;perfect little girl&quot;. She just didn&#39;t mention the fact it had come from severe brainwashing. So you found yourself spending longer in the form, unable to protest the situation, @@.girlVoice;I will not complain@@.

Mom would figure out the ruse eventually, probably, but until then you&#39;d&#39; act the exemplar of a @@.girlVoice;good girl@@, following @@.girlVoice;every rule@@ you&#39;d been taught. Your teacher would be so proud...

If you wouldn&#39;t say the words then how would you ever learn the lesson?

Teacher seemed unphased by your refusal, it seemed that she was prepared for just such an eventuality. She walked to the back of the room, grabbing a previously non-existent television on a cart.

Wheeling it to the front of the class she looked back at you with a cold glare. A shiver went up your spine and you suddenly found your desk to be the only one there. Straight in front of the television, only a few feet away.

The lights went out and the screen flickered to life. The rest of the room was impossibly dark, the light from the screen didn&#39;t spread out at all, it illuminated you, your desk, and nothing else. You couldn&#39;t even see where the teacher had gone. 

A cartoon rabbit suddenly appeared on screen.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Hi there kids,&quot;@@ the rabbit gave a wave. You realized with some amusement that the voice was actually just your mother&#39;s, with the pitch shifted up.

[[The show began|Get Mean Ending No Participate 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="520" name="Get Mean Ending No Participate 2" tags="" position="1225,6475" size="100,100">What ensued was a truly insipid show with a painfully obvious message repeated ad nauseam. This show seemed more targeted at toddlers than someone Emily&#39;s age&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;, and you were a lot more mature than that&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;. Though that might have been the point. It would have been embarrassing for Emily, the same way it was embarrassing for you right now.

@@.momVoice;&quot;And remember kids, you always have to do what mommy tells you.&quot;@@

It was probably the fifth time in the last five minutes that point had been made. You understood exactly what it was driving at, but that didn&#39;t mean you cared. You hadn&#39;t obeyed the mom-bot, why would you pay any attention to this stupid rabbit?

Except it was the only thing you could pay attention to. The rest of the room was filled with impenetrable darkness, so there was nothing to see. The human mind wasn&#39;t good at ignoring bright flashing lights, and this was the only source in the room. So even when you tried to let your eyes wander they always wandered back to the screen.

Your stomach tightened; this was going to take forever. There must have been twenty or thirty rules on the board, if each of these episodes was five minutes you&#39;d be here for&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 8&gt;&gt;...a long time.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; at least two hours.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Assuming you only had to watch them once. You knew time in here flowed differently, so it&#39;d only be seconds on the outside, but that didn&#39;t speed it up at all for you, stuck in here.

The next episode had started.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Oh no! Mr Puppy has made a mess. Remember kids, if you make a mess, you have to clean it up.&quot;@@

[[The show continued|Get Mean Ending No Participate 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="521" name="Get Mean Ending No Participate 3" tags="" position="100,6600" size="100,100">One episode blended into the next.

...

@@.momVoice;&quot;Oh no, Mr. cat won&#39;t share his ball. What should we do?&quot;@@

//Yeah yeah, sharing is great, everyone should share.// Was there any way to speed this up? You&#39;d gotten so used to the format that you could practically predict the next line. Not that it was any great feat to do so, it was //that// obvious.

Yet you still had nothing else to do but watch. You were trapped in this classroom. Even if you could leave your chair there was no where else to go. Until the teacher decided you&#39;d learned your lesson, you wouldn&#39;t leave. Maybe you should have just parroted the lines, it would have been faster. More embarrassing, but faster.

...

@@.momVoice;&quot;And remember kids, if you use it, take care of it.&quot;@@

@@.momVoice;&quot;say please and thank you&quot;@@
@@.momVoice;&quot;be nice to everyone you meet&quot;@@
@@.momVoice;&quot;always be honest&quot;@@

...

Not only was each episode repetitive to a painful degree, but sometimes a different episode had basically the same lesson. You&#39;d heard variants of &quot;do as you&#39;re told&quot; and &quot;be nice&quot; a half dozen times each.

[[The show continued|Get Mean Ending No Participate 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="522" name="Get Mean Ending No Participate 4" tags="" position="225,6600" size="100,100">That was hardly the last time you would hear them. 

Your initial fears about twenty or thirty rules had proven to be grossly underestimated. Since you&#39;d started counting you were already past 35, and you&#39;d missed the first few. 

Yet it proved impossible to tune out. Even when an episode was riffing on a theme you&#39;d heard before it was //just// different enough as to steal some of your attention. The words slightly change, or there were new characters, or a sudden song. You didn&#39;t want to concentrate on it, but when it was the only stimuli in the room, it was hard not to.

...

Finally at your breaking point you shifted tactics. Maybe teacher would be satisfied if you properly watched a few. Really showed that you were paying attention. So you paid your full attention to the annoying rabbit, currently blathering on about the importance of @@.momVoice;&quot;always making your bed.&quot;@@

Yet once you gave it your full attention, it proved difficult to get it back. There was something @@.girlVoice;captivating@@ about the way the bunny moved, always bouncing around the screen. It&#39;s voice, despite you knowing it&#39;s origin, was quiet enough to be soothing, but perky enough to be exciting.

There were other characters, but they weren&#39;t important, they barely ever spoke. Your attention stayed squarely on the rabbit, your mind trying to figure out //why// you were so @@.girlVoice;fascinated@@.

[[Follow the rabbit|Get Mean Ending No Participate 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="523" name="Get Mean Ending No Participate 5" tags="" position="350,6600" size="100,100">With your attention fully on the rabbit the rest of the show seemed to fall away. You could hear the words, and see the other animal characters, but you weren&#39;t really aware of them. The words floated by your ears, directly into your subconscious.

//Why can&#39;t I stop watching this rabbit?//

There had been a discomfort building in your chest, an awareness that you should probably stop watching, but you couldn&#39;t get your eyes to obey. When you tried something would always happen to snap them right back. The rabbit always had the exact right timing to ensure you specifically never lost focus.

So you watched...and watched...and watched...

You noticed impossibly small details. Frames where the drawings were slightly off model, moments where the rabbit stretched its whole body for emphasis. You even discovered that it&#39;s eyes weren&#39;t perfectly black, but an incredibly dark gray.

So you watched the rabbit...watched the rabbit...watched the rabbit...watch...rabbit...

At some point your mind outwardly shut down. Your eyes still followed the rabbit, but there was no thought there.

The TV turned off with a suddenness that had you staring at a blank screen for several more moments. Wiping the drool from the corner of your mouth you blearily looked around the room. The lights were back on, and everything looked basically the same as before.

@@.girlThought;Where is the rabbit?@@ Instinctively you searched for it, it&#39;s presence having become a fixture in your mind. When it proved absent you weren&#39;t sure if you should be relieved or terrified.

@@.momVoice;&quot;That&#39;s enough television for today.&quot;@@ Teacher spoke as she wheeled the TV back to the corner of the room. Acting like it wasn&#39;t her that had caused that impromptu TV marathon.

@@.momVoice;&quot;You&#39;ve learned your lesson, so you may go.&quot;@@

//Lesson? I didn&#39;t learn anything. That rabbit didn&#39;t say anything that wasn&#39;t blindingly obvious.//

But you were glad to be free, so you took the easy route and just nodded.

In the end your behaviour was almost entirely outside of your control. The only difference was how much frustration you were going to put yourself through.

	Your body started shrinking. You barely had time to whimper as you finally crossed over to @@.girlVoice;being a girl@@. But that wasn&#39;t the most important part of this transformation. That was made clear as your eye level started to drop below Sophie&#39;s.

	It&#39;d only a been a few years lost, but your body felt so much @@.girlVoice;weaker@@. Any hint of your old male strength was gone. You were just a @@.girlVoice;little girl@@, with a body that didn&#39;t seem accustomed to intense physical activity.

	Sophie looked down at you. 
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerAge == 10&gt;&gt;\
	The transformation was actually quite slight. You&#39;d already become accustomed to the shrinking sensations that came with the sleepover&#39;s magic. So you weren&#39;t as freaked out as your body continued to compact down. The most concerning part was the feeling of @@.girlVoice;weakness@@ that seemed to suffuse your body.

	You hadn&#39;t had much of your manly strength left, but this seemed to rob you of what little remained. It didn&#39;t seem like you had muscles at all. Something that put you in an obvious contrast to Sophie, currently looking down at you.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

The two of you were probably about the same age, but she was undoubtedly the taller, and stronger one. She grinned as the realization crossed your face.

Emily needed only a moment to come to a decision. The two of you had actually grown closer during the party, so you doubted she would do anything too terrible. Then again Emily&#39;s idea of &#39;reasonable&#39; was rather warped. She&#39;d thought regressing your mind and body had been great fun. It was fairly clear that you were going to end up some flavour of little girl, but what exactly did she have in mind?

@@.momVoice;&quot;Interesting,&quot;@@ your mother spoke after hearing Emily&#39;s request, @@.momVoice;&quot;we shall have to see how that goes.&quot;@@

Your mother finding something &#39;interesting&#39; didn&#39;t make you feel any better. She&#39;d probably thought this whole party was &#39;interesting&#39;.

You grumbled to yourself, how had you ended up with such a crazy sister and mother? Were all witches like this? Or did you just get a weird set? Either way there was little you could do about it right now.

Your mother began to move her hands through an arcane gesture before you felt her power wash over you.

[[Weather the changes|Emily High Happiness Ending 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="539" name="Emily High Happiness Ending 2" tags="" position="1100,6725" size="100,100">The first thing you were struck by, as you felt the magic work over your body, was how familiar this felt. You wouldn&#39;t have said you could detect the &#39;flavour&#39; of a magic, but you could recognize a pattern. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &gt;= 14&gt;&gt;You&#39;d never actually had your body changed that much, so what came next was all new territory for you.&lt;&lt;elseif $oldPlayerAge &gt;=11&gt;&gt;Though it felt stronger than it had last time. Likely this meant you&#39;d end up younger than before.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;d gone through this whole thing before. You just hoped it wouldn&#39;t become a routine.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You watched as your hand got smaller and smaller. It wasn&#39;t the only thing changing, but there was something fascinating about watching something so simple change into something nearly unrecognisable. Knowing something like the &#39;back of your hand&#39; didn&#39;t really apply when that hand had lost every hair it&#39;d had on it. When every rough spot was being smoothed out until it @@.girlVoice;shone like porcelain@@. When it ended up half the size it&#39;d been before and it looked like it would shatter if you tried anything too strenuous. Even the lines on your palm seemed different. You couldn&#39;t exactly remember the pattern of them before, but they stood out stronger on your more youthful hands; no red dry patches to obscure their criss crossing pattern. 

Would your fingerprints even be the same now? Obviously they would be smaller than before, but what of the pattern? If TV was to be believed everyone had their own entirely unique fingerprint. Did you still have your unique pattern? Or was it a new one? This didn&#39;t matter, certainly not in comparison to the changes you felt washing over the rest of you. But you could deal with those changes later.

You turned your hand this way and that, examining every nuance of it as the changes slowed. Marvelling at how thin your fingers were becoming. How the nails, which looked so @@.girlVoice;delicate@@ now, were just a touch longer than before, yet fastidiously taken care of. A sign of consistent nail care that you&#39;d never done in your life. 

There was a strange implication of a little girl having nails that nice. Had you been taking care of them, for years, by yourself? Surely you would have been too young, mom must have. Did your mother know about the responsibility she was retroactively taking on? Surely you were looking far too deeply into this, but the hyperfocus helped keep you composed. 

Finally the changes seemed to come to an end, your new hands settling into their final form. Bereft of anything new to examine you took stock of the rest of your body.

[[Check yourself|Emily High Happiness Ending 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="540" name="Emily High Happiness Ending 3" tags="" position="1225,6725" size="100,100">It was no surprise that the rest of you had shrunk along with your hand. The loss in size made abundantly clear by the fact that your pants had fallen down and your socks were each big enough to hold two of your @@.girlVoice;dainty@@ feet. Your shirt was the only garment that had managed to hang on. Now acting as a loose oversized dress.

Many of the changes you&#39;d observed on your hand were replicated elsewhere. Limbs @@.girlVoice;small and delicate@@. Skin @@.girlVoice;soft and blemish free@@. Though it did leave one major question of what your face looked like. You already knew you had long blonde hair, it&#39;d fallen across your vision almost immediately, but what of the rest?

Your mother summoned a small mirror in front of you, letting you see the totality of your changes. Though at first you thought that the mirror was broken. The face staring back at you was vastly too familiar, in fact it was one that you saw basically every day. It was one of the few faces that you knew better than your own.

Emily&#39;s bright blue eyes stared back at you. Wavy blonde hair framed an @@.girlVoice;angelic@@ face with @@.girlVoice;adorably rosy@@ cheeks. Normally it wouldn&#39;t be at all weird to see that face.It got weird when a second version of her came into frame, your sister having come to stand beside you.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;We&#39;re twins!&quot;@@ She squealed, clearly pleased with the results. She grabbed your hand, putting it palm out and then matching it with her own. True to her word they were an exact match, each finger as long and thin as it&#39;s reflection, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;oh my gosh this is going to be so much fun.&quot;@@

You looked back into the mirror. The only difference between you being that you didn&#39;t match her wide smile. You were disconcerted by the change. A younger you was one thing, but this felt more personal. You weren&#39;t you anymore, you were her, or at least a copy of her.

You tugged at the hem of your skirt and adjusted your silly bow tie, but your mother brushed your hands away.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Stop fussing. You look perfect.&quot;@@

Perfect for a little girl maybe, but far from your idea of perfect. This outfit was ridiculous. Emily went to public school, they didn&#39;t have uniforms, but that hadn&#39;t stopped her from dressing you up like a @@.girlVoice;preppy schoolgirl@@. You&#39;d expected your mother to veto the outfit in lieu of something more sensible. But instead she&#39;d been overjoyed at how @@.girlVoice;cute@@ you looked.

White blouse, red plaid skirt and a bow tie to match. The skirt even had four gold colored buttons on the front. These did nothing but add some flair. Between that and the fake school crest it was clear that this wasn&#39;t a proper school uniform, but heavily evoking one while being extra @@.girlVoice;cute@@. Emily had even found some black Mary Jane shoes and white socks to round out the outfit.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;But mom,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you hated how @@.girlVoice;childish and whiny@@ that sounded, but how else were you supposed to raise your concerns?

@@.momVoice;&quot;No buts. Emily picked a lovely outfit for you. I&#39;m sure the other girls will love it.&quot;@@

You didn&#39;t want your wardrobe choices to be dictated by what would impress eight year olds, but between the two of them you didn&#39;t have much choice.

[[Time for school|Emily High Happiness Ending 8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="545" name="Emily High Happiness Ending 8" tags="" position="600,6850" size="100,100">Annoyingly Emily and your mother had been entirely right. The other girls, and even the teacher, //loved// your outfit. The boys scoffed at it, but most of them were still at the age where girls had @@.girlVoice;cooties@@.

Furthermore it seemed your mom and Emily had worked out an entire backstory for this. You were a cousin from out of town...yes the two of you looked super alike...everyone always said you looked like you could be @@.girlVoice;twins@@...you weren&#39;t sure how long you&#39;d be around.

Emily even supplied the fact that you were @@.girlvoice;awfully shy@@, so all you had to do was nod along as Emily wove her tale.

Class itself was obviously mind numbing. Your head was still a little messy from the party, but not so much that grade 3 Math would cause you problems. You&#39;d learned how to carry the one for addition an eon ago. Apparently it was the newest concept for Emily and her peers. Although, once you all started on your worksheets it was clear you weren&#39;t the only one who&#39;d been reading ahead.

Kara was done in a flash and had moved on to help other students. Technically you could do the same, and better, but the last thing you wanted to do was draw any more attention to yourself.

The rest of the day continued much as it started, learning trivial things you&#39;d mastered ages ago. Lunch was perhaps the worst part. Every girl seemed to want to know more and more about you. Turned out that Emily was rather popular among her peers, which meant they were automatically interested in anyone related to her. 

With Emily&#39;s help you were able to get through without slipping up. Flying under the radar for the rest of the day. Only when you were walking home together did Emily drop the act.

[[Did ya have fun?|Emily High Happiness Ending 9]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="546" name="Emily High Happiness Ending 9" tags="" position="725,6850" size="100,100">On the whole the day had been boring, frustrating and embarrassing. Though you had to admit that at lunch, despite how much you&#39;d hated it at first, it was @@.girlVoice;kind of fun@@ to be among that gaggle of excited girls. There were no secret agendas or arcane social rituals there, they were just excited by the possibility of making a new friend. There was joy in the simplicity. But you weren&#39;t ready to admit that to Emily. So you simply shook your head and hurried home in silence.

Mom asked the same question and you gave the same answer, excusing yourself to your room under the pretext of doing your &#39;homework&#39;. Not that it would take you more than two minutes, it was for children after all.

But you couldn&#39;t escape conversation forever and you&#39;d been forced to come down to socialize during dinner. Mom asked for endless details about the day. Luckily Emily was more than happy to provide, giving a detailed run-down of every moment of the day. Though, to your ears, she was embellishing things. She made it sound like you&#39;d had tons of fun and that you were already making friends. It seemed wrong, but it did make you consider, what if you had enjoyed it more than you were willing to admit? 

[[The next morning|Emily High Happiness Ending 9-2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="547" name="Emily High Happiness Ending 9-2" tags="" position="850,6850" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/EmilyHigh/2.webp&#39; &quot;topRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\
This thought stuck with you all the way until the next morning when it was once again time for elementary school. You had a whole new outfit. This time it less aggressively &#39;schoolgirl&#39;, but still undoubtedly &#39;little girl&#39;. A white t-shirt emblazoned with &quot;Love&quot; and a black skirt with a little frill.

Emily was her usual excited self; practically dragging you out the door. The day progressed much the same. Everyone was excited to see you. They loved your outfit. Class was boring. Lunch was socially overwhelming. You could barely believe that the girls were just as excited on day 2 as they had been on day 1. It was soothing in it&#39;s own way, that relentless optimism. So easy to get drawn into it and stop caring about the craziness and complexity of the &#39;big kid&#39; world.

Once you got home you made yourself a deal. Mom wasn&#39;t going to turn you back until you &#39;learned your lesson&#39; and it seemed a large part of the benchmark for that was your participation. So for the last three days of the week you&#39;d let yourself just be present and go with the flow. You weren&#39;t about to start @@.girlVoice;giggling about princesses@@, but you would at least try and participate.

On Wednesday you were sure Emily had gone too far. A blue @@.girlVoice;frilly@@ blouse with torn jean shorts. You figured it would look more at home on a five year old than an eight year old. But either your sense of the latest in grade three fashion was off. Or the other girls just loved to talk about clothes. It turned out to be both. Your outfits been the focus of the last few days. You were a novelty after all. But you&#39;d been dragged into other conversations about @@.girlVoice;cute dresses and skirts@@. It seemed that @@.girlVoice;hyper girly and childish@@ were all the rage. Then again maybe these weren&#39;t childish to them, they were only eight after all.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/EmilyHigh/4.webp&#39; &quot;smallMiddleLeft noTopMargin&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Thursday was a flowy white dress with black trim around the collar. A @@.girlVoice;delicate ribbon@@ looped around your neck and tied behind your back. It was pretty clear that Emily was trying to run you through the gamut of girl clothes. @@.girlVoice;Skirts and blouses. Dresses and ribbons.@@ The whole nine yards. As before everyone loved it. They wondered aloud how Emily would look in the dress before realizing the absurdity of the question. She&#39;d look just like you did, since you looked just like she did.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;height: 332px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/EmilyHigh/5.webp&#39; &quot;smallTopRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Friday&#39;s outfit was odd. Not because it was over the top, but because it wasn&#39;t. All the other outfits had clearly been Emily trying different things, going over the top into specific styles. But today it was simple. A white t-shirt and a jean skirt, with some roses for decoration. It felt less like Emily playing dress up with you as the @@.girlVoice;doll@@ and more like something you&#39;d just wear on a normal day.

That thought put you in an odd mental state. It was less a performance and more of just a day. Dozing through boring classes, eating lunch, wishing for the weekend. When the day ended you even reflexively said &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;see you next week,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; as the girls waved goodbye.
&lt;/div&gt;

She knew you were upset, but wanted to give you space. Space wasn&#39;t something you had much of these days at this point the two of you spent almost every waking hour with each other. Heck, you even spent your sleeping hours together now, since you shared the same bed. You were pretty sure you were old enough to have your own bed, but Emily had insisted. It&#39;d be annoying except you&#39;d never slept better in your life. Sharing your morning routine also seemed to make the whole thing just a little more enjoyable. It&#39;d been so easy to just follow along with Emily and mimic her actions until they became natural.

But Emily was only eight, how was she supposed to broach this subject? It was way outside of her experience. Luckily mom noticed as well, and she had a much better sense of what was going on. She sat you down once you&#39;d had a chance to decompress from the day.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Did you have a good day at school &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;?&quot;@@ That name didn&#39;t even seem unusual anymore, you&#39;d heard it so many times over the last five days that it really did feel like your name.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I-I did, I think.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

I can really tell that you&#39;ve grown closer with Emily.&quot;@@

It was obviously true. Being immersed in that world reminded you of what it was like. It was mostly carefree fun, but it came with it&#39;s own set of challenges. So you understood better why sometimes it seemed like she was being a brat. Why sometimes she so desperately wanted your attention.

@@.momVoice;&quot;I have a proposal for you. This magic will hold basically indefinitely, and a two week absence isn&#39;t too different from one. So, if you want, you could spend one more week like this.&quot;@@

You bit your lip. At the start of the week your answer would have been obvious. You&#39;d been counting down the minutes until you could be back to your normal self. But that had changed. This little body, waking up beside Emily, going to school with the girls, all felt normal. Better than normal in fact. Once you&#39;d let yourself relax this week was way more better than high school ever had been. You&#39;d already had more friends in Emily&#39;s class than you did in your own. One more week did have it&#39;s appeal...

But it wasn&#39;t who you were, you were just playing at being a @@.girlVoice;little girl@@. There was a difference between play acting for a week and actually living that life. Who wouldn&#39;t enjoy a week off as a kid? None of the responsibilities, no worries, no concerns, you could just relax. 

Your mom nodded, though she looked slightly disappointed about what you thought would have been the obvious answer. @@.momVoice;&quot;That&#39;s fair, you must be true to yourself. I&#39;ll turn you back, but I do have a condition. I want you to prove to me that you&#39;ve really learned your lesson.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Fair,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you agreed. It shouldn&#39;t be much of an issue, it was pretty easy to be on your best behaviour for a week. Plus you really had grown a little closer to Emily, so you&#39;d probably pass even without trying.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Good. Now to keep things fair I&#39;ll be erasing this part of the conversation from your memory. It&#39;s not a real test it you know you&#39;re being tested. Now is it?&quot;@@ Before you could protest there was a flash in front of your eyes.

You blinked, trying to get your bearings. You&#39;d been talking to your mom about turning back, and now you were back to normal. So mission complete?

@@.momVoice;&quot;A little disorientation is to be expected after such a dramatic change. Try not to do anything too strenuous this evening. Maybe you can get started on your homework from the last week.&quot;.@@

You groaned, you&#39;d forgotten about the fact your real homework was piling up on the side. You&#39;d been spending your time learning times tables and the names of baby animals, but no one could escape calculus forever.

High school five days a week with all the attendant perks and annoyances. You&#39;d enjoyed being able to glide through your homework in ten minutes. Now you had to actually work at it. 

Plus Emily had decided that you were also a valid source to ask for homework assistance, rather than just mom. At first you&#39;d been inclined to just reject her and wave her off as usual. But having just gone through that homework yourself, you had a little sympathy. So you helped her out.

It actually became a bit of a routine, and the two of you started doing homework in the same room. She benefited from the help, and you enjoyed the little breaks her presence provided. It wasn&#39;t that the two of you were best buddies, you were still eight years apart, but things were a lot better.

At the end of the week your mother sat you down one more time. Snapping her fingers before she&#39;d even spoken. Once she did the lock on your memory broke and your heart dropped. That whole week had been a test? Had you been that nice to Emily? Sure you&#39;d helped her study but the two of you still clashed at least once a day. You weren&#39;t overly enthused about the idea of being back in a dress.

Yes the two of you fought, but I wasn&#39;t expecting perfection. A boy and a girl eight years apart? There are going to be fights, that&#39;s just having a sibling.&quot;@@ 

You knew your mom had a sister, and from the stories you&#39;d heard the two of them had gotten into plenty of fights. And that was a fight with magic, so you could barely imagine how destructive that could get.

@@.momVoice;&quot;As long as the two of you can keep some amount of peace there isn&#39;t a need for anything more drastic. Just keep helping your sister with her homework and try to be patient with her. And I&#39;ll make sure she doesn&#39;t turn your entire wardrobe into pink frilly dresses...again.&quot;@@ You nodded, breathing a sigh of relief at the bullet dodged. 

Life was really and truly back to normal. Except now you and Emily actually got along...mostly. You&#39;d even offered to supervise her next sleepover, under the caveat that your age and mind were off limits. You&#39;d let them paint your nails and do your hair, but that was it. 

She&#39;d smiled and agreed. You were fairly sure she&#39;d do //something// to break the rules, she was eight after all, you couldn&#39;t expect her to behave like an adult. So as long as she didn&#39;t make you behave like a five year old you could tolerate it...probably...time would tell...

You tried to justify the decision in that you needed more time to really learn your lesson. Though you never specified what the lesson actually was, or what it would take to learn it...so it was easy to ask for more time again the next week.

One more week turned into two, then three, then a month and a half. Long enough that you were almost impossibly far behind in your &#39;normal&#39; studies. For whatever reason mom didn&#39;t seem too concerned. Every week she asked you if you wanted to turn back and every week you deferred the decision another week. 

As much as class was boring, you were enjoying school. A respite from all the complications of your &#39;real&#39; life. There was calming monotony to it all. Get up, pick a @@.girlVoice;cute outfit@@ with Emily and walk to school. Boring classes in the morning, @@.girlVoice;fun with the girls@@ at lunch, PE in the afternoon and then another boring class. Home time, dinner, finish your homework, get to bed. Every moment of it with Emily at your side. You&#39;d actually started to get a little uncomfortable when she wasn&#39;t around, and she&#39;d admitted the same was true for her. 

You had settled into such a rhythm that you had an automatic response to mom&#39;s question of &#39;one more week?&#39;

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Um...uh...maybe I could stay just one more week?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; At this point it was obvious that you&#39;d be saying &#39;one more week&#39; forever. You just hadn&#39;t admitted it to yourself yet.

But mother knows best. She sat down beside you and took your hand.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Sweetie,&quot;@@ you&#39;d gotten used to that nickname, @@.momVoice;&quot;it&#39;s okay if you want to stay this way. Emily and mommy love you very much no matter what you look like.&quot;@@

You looked away, still feeling a little ashamed about your budding decision. You&#39;d wanted to ask, but saying it unprompted...it was too much. Now mom had given you permission, which meant you were &#39;allowed&#39; to say it.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I-I wanna stay this way,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; your voice was so soft that it was barely audible.

@@.momVoice;&quot;That&#39;s very brave sweetie, I know that was hard to say,&quot;@@ her voice was soothing and she gently kissed your forehead, dispelling any fears you&#39;d had about her being mad.

@@.momVoice;&quot;I&#39;ll take care of everything to make it official.&quot;@@ The surety of how she spoke made one thing very clear, she&#39;d already thought about this, she&#39;d already planned this. She&#39;d just been waiting for you to recognize your own feelings.

@@.momVoice;&quot;There is one more thing to consider. You&#39;ve told me that school is awfully boring for you, since you&#39;ve done it all before. I can fix that, but there are a few options.&quot;@@

[[Options?|Emily High Happiness Ending Stay Little 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="555" name="Emily High Happiness Ending Stay Little 2" tags="" position="600,6975" size="100,100">@@.momVoice;&quot;The mind is a complicated thing. A change to one thing can have unexpected side effects. It&#39;s simple enough for surface level, or temporary changes like you experienced at the party.&quot;@@ 

You hadn&#39;t really thought much about it, pretending to be an eight year old girl took up enough of your mental capacity. However, you realized that any mental alterations from the sleepover had faded away weeks ago. Mentally you were the 16 year old boy you.

@@.momVoice;&quot;I can only imagine the strain of having to juggle two personas. So, if you want, I can make some alterations to make things easier on you. Locking away all that old school knowledge. You&#39;ll still remember your old life, they&#39;ll just be a few holes here and there. But you will get all the fun of learning your times tables, same as your classmates.&quot;@@

You weren&#39;t sure that &#39;re-learning times tables&#39; was a major selling point for this plan. It was hard to say how you&#39;d even feel about school going through it this time. It was such a different life that maybe you&#39;d like French instead and hate Math, or maybe nothing would change at all. Either way it was appealing. You&#39;d be spending more time doing homework, but you&#39;d also be able to commiserate properly with the other girls, struggling and triumphing together.

@@.momVoice;&quot;There are two other options. Instead of just locking away the knowledge, I could lock away everything that happened to you after grade 3. You&#39;d have all your normal memories up until that point, but after that would be blank. The sleepover would be the last day of the old boy you. Living your life unburdened by two sets of contradictory memories.&quot;@@

@@.momVoice;&quot;The extension to that would be to remove all of them, of all your time being a boy. You&#39;d still know about the existence of that old life, but it will feel more like a story than a memory. I&#39;ll craft you a whole new set of little girl memories to fill in those missing years. They&#39;ll be mostly based on Emily&#39;s and there may be some oddities, but most people can&#39;t remember much of their early childhood properly anyway. You&#39;d have a whole new life to live.&quot;@@

You noticed she hadn&#39;t recommended or warned away from any of the choices. You&#39;d tried to glean some preference off of her but she&#39;d kept herself neutral. She wouldn&#39;t interfere with your choice. It was yours and yours alone.

You would love to put the blame onto Emily, but it wouldn&#39;t work at this point, the other girls had backed her story that you were the issue. 

Which meant Emily didn&#39;t take any time at all to make her decision. Mom leaned down to hear her desire. It was loud enough that the other girls could hear it but you were left out of the loop.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Seems very reasonable,&quot;@@ that was all mom said before she turned to you, hands extended. You braced yourself, you&#39;d already been changed over the course of the party, but that had always been a slow thing. This change was likely to happen all at once. The best you could hope for was to mostly keep your mind, you knew your age and gender were forfeit. 

Mom began to mumble under her breath as her fingers weaved a complex pattern. You felt tingling begin to suffuse your body, your transformation was starting.

There was a pleasant warmth to the magic as it ran throughout your body. Apparently your mom didn&#39;t want the transformation itself to be a terrible experience. The life you&#39;d have to live the week after was the punishment.

Your head swam as your vision warped, your entire perspective of the room shifting. It wasn&#39;t a surprise that you were getting shorter but it was disorienting for it to happen this. You couldn&#39;t know when exactly that was going to stop but already your entire outfit had become a tent. Leaving you standing in a pile of clothes wearing naught but a shirt that was currently a mini-dress and inching closer to your knees every moment.

You were concerned about how stable you would be post-transformation, so you took the risky move of stepping out of the pile. Leaving your pants, socks and underwear behind you. You looked down, the dress now to your knees, marvelling at how small your feet had gotten. It was a wonder you could even balance on something that small. They didn&#39;t even feel like they were yours. You wiggled your toes to confirm, watching to see your new @@.girlVoice;tiny toes@@ responded to your command. You @@.girlVoice;giggled@@ at how @@.girlVoice;silly@@ you were being, frowning once you&#39;d caught yourself. The regression to your mind was becoming severe, if that&#39;d been enough to amuse you.

Little toes weren&#39;t the only think shrinking a distressing pace. The dress was past your knees now, but the body inside it only took up a fraction of the space. Even the sleeves of the t-shirt were starting to swallow your thinning arms. You were getting really young, potentially even younger than Miki&lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt; 6&gt;&gt;, though it wouldn&#39;t be the first time.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.

[[The changes continued|Emily Low Happiness Ending 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="563" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending 3" tags="" position="350,7100" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;/silently&gt;&gt;
There was a change in how your body was morphing. It was subtle, but with nothing else to do you were very attentive to detail. You were still getting shorter, but you&#39;d stopped getting thinner, in fact you&#39;d started to gain some extra flab. Your legs got a little thicker, making them look a bit stumpy. The same was happening with your arms. You put your hands to your stomach, feeling the @@.girlVoice;little pudge @@that was building there. A quick pinch of your @@.girlVoice;chubby cheeks@@ confirmed what it was, @@.girlVoice;baby fat@@.

That was when you really started to worry. How young was she planning to make you? Surely she couldn&#39;t be making you into an actual baby. What kind of lesson could be learned if you couldn&#39;t even speak? The &#39;dress&#39; was down to your ankles, slipping off your shoulders and you were still shrinking.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Mom?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you squeaked out, shocked at how high your voice had gotten.

Mom didn&#39;t answer, simply standing with the group and watching the final moments of your transformation. The hem of your dress touched the ground, starting to bunch up on the floor. The former shirt had fallen off your shoulders and was barely stuck holding onto your upper arms, leaving your collarbone exposed. Your hands were almost entirely engulfed by the sleeves. 

You elected to stay still, any shift might cause it to fall off entirely and you didn&#39;t want to end up completely in the buff. Mercifully the changes seemed to have stopped, but you&#39;d ended up young, very young. A couple years younger than Miki, and at this age every year was a massive gap in physical and mental maturity.

You waited another moment to ensure that everything had stopped, but the tingles had faded and your form had stabilized at @@.girlVoice;tiny and adorable@@.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Don&#39;t worry, that&#39;s as young as you&#39;ll get for now.&quot;@@ Mom&#39;s words did little to make you feel more comfortable, @@.momVoice;&quot;Emily thought you would learn your lesson better if you had an age gap more like she&#39;d had. I couldn&#39;t make you an infant, so a preschooler will have to do. Just be glad you&#39;re not a toddler&quot;.@@

[[You gulped|Emily Low Happiness Ending 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="564" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending 4" tags="" position="475,7100" size="100,100">You wouldn&#39;t put it past mom to make you even younger. You&#39;d have to be on your best behaviour if you wanted to keep your ability to walk and talk.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Yes @@.girlVoice;mommy@@.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Internally you winced at the word choice. You still wanted to try and keep some dignity, but calling her anything else felt too weird to even try.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;Oh my gosh she&#39;s so cute.&quot;@@ Kara squealed, to the agreement of the other girls. Within moments they had surrounded you. If you&#39;d been unsure about your size this confirmed it. Even Miki had almost half a foot on you, Sophie seemed like a giant compared to you.

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;She needs a new dress,&quot;@@ Miki giggled. They all thought your current apparel was @@.girlVoice;adorable@@, but it could slip off at any moment and was already a tripping hazard.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Come on, let&#39;s get you something.&quot;@@ Emily prodded you, offering her hand. The movement enough to dislodge the last of your clothes. Leaving you entirely naked in front of them.

Your automatic response wasn&#39;t to cover yourself, in fact you didn&#39;t do anything, because you didn&#39;t feel like you needed to. You&#39;d expected a rush of embarrassment and shame at the situation, but @@.girlVoice;none came@@. Nothing seemed odd about being naked in front of the girls, in fact you almost @@.girlVoice;felt more comfortable@@ like this. You&#39;d seen this behaviour in toddlers before, nudity didn&#39;t bother them, they hadn&#39;t yet developed that @@.girlVoice;sense of propriety@@.

The girls said nothing about the situation, though Emily and Sophie did cast each other an amused glance. The tripping hazard removed they started dragging you upstairs. The stairs were the first of many challenges that day. You were able to handle them, but it required serious concentration, and even with your full attention it was @@.girlVoice;slow and awkward@@. Your legs being so short was part of the problem, but there seemed to be a fundamental disconnect between your brain and your legs. Your control over them was coarse, sometimes moving more, sometimes less than you&#39;d meant. Walking was fine enough, but climbing seemed to be a @@.girlVoice;developing skill@@.

[[Get Dressed|Emily Low Happiness Ending 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="565" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending 5" tags="" position="600,7100" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/EmilyLow/Day0.webp&#39; &quot;topRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Apparently the oversized look was @@.girlVoice;too cute@@ to let go. The dress you ended up in was not dissimilar in form to the shirt you&#39;d been wearing a few minutes ago. It still fit you like a tent, but the collar tapered down enough that it wouldn&#39;t fall off. Plus the hemline also stopped just above your knees, rather than on the floor. Thematically however, it was @@.girlVoice;unambiguously girly@@. It was @@.girlVoice;rainbow striped@@ with a prominent smiley face. So instead of stealing a shirt from your big brother, you&#39;d stolen one from your @@.girlVoice;big sister@@. You did not consider this an improvement. At least it meant you didn&#39;t have to worry about tripping over the shirt, you&#39;d just have to worry about your own feet...

Once you&#39;d all gotten back downstairs mom concurred with the girls on their choice, it was @@.girlVoice;very adorable@@. But then she shooed you all away, there was still a few hours before everyone would get picked up, no reason to stop playing. You would have much preferred to stay out of things and get this over with as quickly as possible. 

In a way you got your wish, but not in the way you would have wanted. After some time spent playing @@.girlVoice;silly childish games@@ the other girls wanted to @@.girlVoice;skip rope@@. Your eye-rolling about the activity didn&#39;t save you from being forced to try. The key word there was &#39;try&#39;, you weren&#39;t actually able to get over the rope more than once. The timing and coordination required was simply beyond you. After only your second failure you could feel the frustration @@.girlVoice;bubbling over@@. If you couldn&#39;t do it right you @@.girlVoice;didn&#39;t want to play at all@@.

Luckily the girls agreed and let you sit out of that activity, and the next, and the next. It wasn&#39;t just because you were being sullen, but also because you were &#39;too little&#39;. It frustrated you to hear, but you couldn&#39;t actually deny it. The games they were playing looked @@.girlVoice;really hard@@. Even if you could physically handle it, which was questionable, some of them had monstrously complex rules. One required you to count by 1s &#39;&#39;and&#39;&#39; 2s, you didn&#39;t even know how that was possible.

[[The sleepover ended|Emily Low Happiness Ending 6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="566" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending 6" tags="" position="725,7100" size="100,100">Finally the other girls went home and the sleepover came to an end. It gave you a moment take stock of your situation. You&#39;d been turned into a four year old girl. This meant that you were @@.girlVoice;small, weak and incapable@@ of most physical activities. Furthermore, you&#39;d lost every piece of knowledge you&#39;d ever gained at school. Even beyond raw knowledge that your mind felt &#39;@@.girlVoice;slow@@&#39;. It&#39;s a difficult thing to explain, but any complex thought felt like it took a while to come together. It was so much easier just to go with an fast thought and move on, even if the fast thought wasn&#39;t right or useful. Patience was not a virtue you possessed in any real amount.

If you didn&#39;t remember that you&#39;d been sixteen a day ago it probably would be tolerable. But you were stuck with this vague sense of loss, you knew that you&#39;d known Math, but didn&#39;t even understand what Math was anymore. Maybe something to do with numbers? 

Still, you had to try and keep hold of yourself, you may look four year old, but you didn&#39;t have to act that way. Though this was a thought you could only hold rationally. Emotionally the idea didn&#39;t embarrassing at all, @@.girlVoice;what was wrong with acting four@@?

A task that gained an extra wrinkle when mom revealed how you&#39;d be spending your week.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Daycawe?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Again you winced. You kept saying things &#39;wrong&#39;, but you couldn&#39;t tell what &#39;right&#39; was to correct it. You think it had something to do with &#39;letters&#39;...but you didn&#39;t even know all the letters.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Yes,&quot;@@ mom had already prepared your bag, with snacks and a few other bits and bobs, @@.momVoice;&quot;I do have to work you know, so I need someone to take care of you while I&#39;m out.&quot;@@

You didn&#39;t actually know what mom did for a living, and that wasn&#39;t a new gap in knowledge. She&#39;d always been quite cagey around the specifics. You knew it had something to do with magic, but that was about it. You also wanted to protest that Emily got to be home all alone from 3-5, but you knew that was a fruitless argument, since she was four years older than you.

Which meant you were shoved into a @@.girlVoice;booster seat@@ and driven to a nearby @@.girlVoice;daycare@@. Nervously walking through the door to an unknown fate.

[[Daycare|Emily Low Happiness Ending 7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="567" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending 7" tags="" position="850,7100" size="100,100">Your senses were assaulted the moment you came in. The whole place was @@.girlVoice;rainbows and unicorns and cartoon rabbits@@. Lots of @@.girlVoice;shiny pretty things@@ to make all the other kids here feel more at ease. Even you had to admit that it lent a cheeriness to the place which calmed you somewhat. Nervousness had been eating at you the whole car ride. Sure it was just some stupid daycare for a week with a bunch of stupid little kids, but you couldn&#39;t help but feel @@.girlVoice;scared@@.

Kids, toddlers and babies it seemed. Even if your eyes hadn&#39;t caught them, your ears were being attacked by the howling of a colicky baby. To compensate there was also light and happy background music suffusing the place. You had no idea what it was from, maybe from some children&#39;s show you missed by a decade. Well, missed the first time, you might get the full experience this week.

The scent of the place was also a clue, it smelled clean, too clean. The only reason a place would smell like this is if there was reason to clean up all the time. Like if there were a dozen messy kids running around and babies who were still working on how to use the &#39;potty&#39;. 

Your other senses were spared the initial assault, but that didn&#39;t last. Once mom had left and you&#39;d joined the rest of the children it was time to &#39;play&#39;. The first activity was, as it was described to parents, &#39;fine motor control practice&#39;. In reality it meant @@.girlVoice;finger painting@@. It left you a rather interesting question, did you want to join in? If you didn&#39;t then there was nothing else to do...and it @@.girlVoice;looked awfully fun@@, and you were @@.girlVoice;bored of waiting@@.

It would be way to @@.girlVoice;boring@@ to just sit around, so you might as well have a little fun while you&#39;re at it. You would have preferred actually having a paint brush, but as you quickly found our your subpar dexterity was far more suited to using your fingers. 

Your &#39;classmates&#39; ranged in age from two to four, with the babies in a different room. You were able to keep yourself a little less messy than the toddlers, but you wouldn&#39;t say that your &#39;art&#39; was all that much better. It really wasn&#39;t clear what you&#39;d painted at all, it had some shapes, but they hadn&#39;t really coalesced into anything coherent. 

Still the daycare workers seemed very impressed by the work you were all doing. It was patronizing to have them compliment such sloppiness, but it also @@.girlVoice;felt nice@@ to hear. After only a few minutes task was over and it was on to the next thing. You were grateful, you&#39;d been painting for ages and you&#39;d been getting bored.

The rest of the morning went fairly smoothly. You had your snack, requiring only a minor cleanup after you were done. Then it was story time. Story time went on for @@.girlVoice;way too long@@, but at least the story was fun.

No one was focused enough to actually be able to play any organized sport so it was mostly just random activities done at your whim. 

Some of the girls were trying to learn how to do cartwheels or little rolls. The two year olds were the @@.girlVoice;most adorable@@ on that point. They put their hands to the ground and then just sort of awkwardly stumbled over. Technically they started and ended in the correct position, they weren&#39;t actually able to do the complex bits in between. You were a @@.girlVoice;little better@@, your legs actually got off the ground, but you weren&#39;t able to keep them vertical like you were supposed to.

After that it was just a bunch of random dancing. Once again you didn&#39;t know the origin of the music, but it was @@.girlVoice;super catchy@@ and you found yourself @@.girlVoice;joining in@@ with the awkward dancing of the others. Even the boys were part of this one, you supposed at this age there wasn&#39;t much difference between boys and girls. Girls just had @@.girlVoice;cuter outfits@@.

Between you and the toddlers, and the babies in the other room there were a lot of mouths to feed. Which meant it was going to take some time to prep, time that they couldn&#39;t keep as good an eye on all of you. So they did what any good adult would when they needed to distract a child. They plopped you all in front of a TV. 

The show was @@.girlVoice;very kiddie@@, even by the standards of your regressed mind. But since it had to be inclusive of the toddlers, it had to be something simple they could enjoy. Which meant that all of the &#39;episodes&#39; were only a couple minutes long, their attention wouldn&#39;t last any longer than that. @@.girlVoice;Nor did yours@@. As time passed and your stomach started grumbling you were done with TV and wanted food.

Unfortunately there was still some work to do. They shuffled off the toddlers to get first dibs. Leaving the older kids with a new, more mature show. This one was about a doctor. She was seven so she knew about all sorts @@.girlVoice;big kid@@ stuff. Like how you shouldn&#39;t hug sick people, or that you should drink lots of water. The amount of info was almost overwhelming. You wished you had some way to note it down, but you could @@.girlVoice;barely hold a pencil properly@@, let alone write with it.

But @@.girlVoice;it wasn&#39;t fair@@, you wanted to keep watching! But your rebellion was short lived and you were coaxed to lunch by the offer of apple slices.

After lunch, and a little free time, it was declared that it was quiet time now. Which was a nice way of saying &#39;nap time&#39; without it sounding quite as @@.girlVoice;babyish@@. You had to admit to feeling a little tired, and since they had @@.girlVoice;helped you brush your teeth@@ you were basically ready for bed.

A couple of the other four year olds had some pictures books that they were reading under their blankets.

You wondered if you should do the same. You were getting tired, but you were also a @@.girlVoice;big girl@@ who didn&#39;t need naps anymore. If you put your mind to it you could stay awake for as long as you wanted. There were lots of pretty pictures to look at, and maybe something fun would happen.

This time you had no dreams at all, it seemed you were so tired that you didn&#39;t even have the energy to dream.

You awoke with a start, not having really meant to fall asleep in the first place. You pulled your @@.girlVoice;thumb from your mouth@@ and wiped the @@.girlVoice;drool@@ onto your hand. Ignoring the wet spot you&#39;d left on the pillow.  It seemed the other kids were waking up as well, only one or two having actually read through all of nap time. Looked like you hadn&#39;t missed anything interesting this time.

The time after the nap was rather chaotic. The remainder of the afternoon would be free play time, but first there was a lot to be attended to. First came the diaper changes, all of the babies needed them of course, and most of the toddlers. A couple even seemed embarrassed about that fact. It seemed that they usually didn&#39;t need diapers during the day, but night time was a different story and naps counted.

You&#39;d been lucky enough to keep your @@.girlVoice;potty training@@, as befit a @@.girlVoice;big girl@@. Mom had warned you that night might be an issue for you too, but the first night had been fine.

It was disconcerting. During the party you&#39;d found yourself slipping into @@.girlVoice;childish@@ or @@.girlVoice;girly@@ behaviours on occasion, but only for a few moments. Today had been different, you&#39;d slipped into that role for hours at a time. It wasn&#39;t anything conscious or intentional, it&#39;d just been the natural way to act, the @@.girlVoice;only way you could even think of acting@@.

Even now it was hard to parse which of those behaviour actually had been @@.girlVoice;childish@@ and which were mature. Your sense of the definition was blurry, the inscrutable actions of adults were too hard to understand. You still had your memories of being a teenager, but the memories were hard to understand. They were saying things and doing things that didn&#39;t make much sense. Why would you change clothes before playing outside? Why had those long writey things made you so anxious? Why did you spend so long staring at weird letters when you found it boring?

You frowned. Was this something mom and Emily had added to make sure you&#39;d behave properly? Or was your brain so small now that it couldn&#39;t handle all those adult thoughts? Even thinking about this all was making your head hurt, and @@.girlVoice;you were a doctor@@! Doctors are supposed to be smart. You bet even Emily wouldn&#39;t understand this.

You were so proud of @@.girlVoice;being a doctor@@ that you forgot what you had actually been thinking about. Instead you began to regale mom with all the tales of your first day in daycare. The speed at which you told the story increased moment by moment as your excitement overwhelmed any concerns about staying coherent. But mom smiled and nodded as if you were telling her the most interesting things in the world. Even if by the end it was mostly @@.girlVoice;incomprehensible gibberish@@.

The only thing you couldn&#39;t understand was why she kept giggling at you so much. Some of the stories were pretty funny, but she was laughing at totally normal things as well. Why was it funny that you&#39;d @@.girlVoice;really enjoyed finger painting@@? Or being @@.girlVoice;proud that you&#39;d been well behaved@@?

It was only after dinner, when you had a few moments alone on the couch that you were able to find enough clarity to realize everything that was happening. Emily was laughing not because the stories were funny, but because you were talking about them like a normal four year old would. In the car, you&#39;d been thinking on this same issue, but you&#39;d slipped back into thinking you were a doctor, before you could reason your way through things.

You did your best to hold on to this train of thought, as much as you were already finding it @@.girlVoice;super boring@@ to think about. There was a reason they had turned you into a girl, but you couldn&#39;t remember exactly why. It was supposed to teach you a lesson about not being mean to Emily, but why did you need to be four to learn that?

Mom just continued to smile, clearly not taking your protests seriously. Picking you up and putting you in the bathtub, kneeling beside the tub herself. What ensued was perhaps the most embarrassing part of your day. Now that you&#39;d regained some clarity about your behaviour, you wanted to reclaim some independence. 

However, mom wasn&#39;t trusting you to bathe alone. Not just to make sure you were safe, but because she couldn&#39;t trust you to do it right. A trust that you didn&#39;t deserve anyway. You were given a brief opportunity to try it yourself, under her supervision. You&#39;d successfully managed to wash about 20% of yourself before calling the job done, @@.girlVoice;beaming with pride@@.

Instead you had to deal with mom scrubbing you and manhandling you and generally @@.girlVoice;treating you like a baby@@. Worse still was, when you were done, Emily went to have her own bath, //on her own//. Mom still stayed nearby, and kept checking in, but she was trusted to do that all by herself.

[[Bed Time|Emily Low Happiness Ending 16-2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="577" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending 16-2" tags="" position="850,7225" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/EmilyLow/Pyjamas.webp&#39; &quot;topRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Meanwhile you were on your bed in your underwear because you couldn&#39;t get your pjs on properly. It seemed like something you should be able to do, but it had been a long day, and you were already frustrated.

@@.girlThought;I should ask mom for help.@@

You shook off the thought, you had to be able to do something on your own. But your attempts were continually frustrated, what you didn&#39;t realize was one of the legs had gotten inside out. But you were so focused on trying to just force it on you hadn&#39;t checked that. You could feel a @@.girlVoice;tantrum coming on@@. However, your energy reserves were low and you fell asleep, face down on your bed, one leg covered by pjs and one still bare, having @@.girlVoice;never successfully gotten dressed@@.

[[The next morning|Emily Low Happiness Ending 17]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="578" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending 17" tags="" position="975,7225" size="100,100">Once again your sleep was dreamless, but that didn&#39;t mean you weren&#39;t waking up into a dreamland. It was only Tuesday, you still had almost the entirety of the week before you. Maybe things would have been a little easier if you&#39;d been in pre-school instead, at least that would try and engage your mind. Daycare didn&#39;t have those kind of educational goals, it was a place to drop your kids and keep them entertained until work was done.

A normal child would have enjoyed that it was less learning and more playing. But to you it was all the more dangerous. It was much easier to fall into childish behaviours when watching a TV show than it was when trying to learn your letters.

However, Tuesday went much the same as Monday. More of your time spent acting as a child than actually remembering who you&#39;d been before. By Wednesday &#39;before&#39; was becoming a very amorphous concept. How long ago had you been different? Was that an entirely different life?

But the fading concerns about your situation meant you were able to enjoy yourself in new ways. Today the workers had put on some music so you could all dance. No particular reason, no greater purpose, just the fun of moving your body. @@.girlVoice;You loved it@@. It was so simple, but there was so much joy there, everyone looked so happy, which made you feel happy, which made you want to dance even more!

Not that you actually did dance much longer. Despite the blissful experience it would quickly grow dull. Luckily the workers seemed to know, shuffling you all off to the next activity. 

@@.girlThought;Can they read my mind?@@ You wondered. @@.girlThought;Can I read minds?@@ You stared at one of the babies, but nothing came to you. Then again baby brains were really little, maybe you&#39;d have to try with someone older later.

[[The day continued|Emily Low Happiness Ending 17-2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="579" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending 17-2" tags="" position="1100,7225" size="100,100">By the time lunch rolled around you&#39;d full acclimatized to the situation. Concerns about anything before today, or after today, had fled your mind. You were having too much fun in the present to worry about that. As you watched you @@.girlVoice;new favourite show@@ you were briefly struck by the possibility that, despite it being a different episode, they were teaching basically all the same lessons. Maybe it was for the toddlers, they&#39;d need to hear a lesson again and again to learn it...but you dismissed the concern. Today&#39;s episode was about the lion not wanting to share his ball with the others. You had a vague recollection that yesterday&#39;s had been about the hippo not sharing her kite. Totally different things. But you still felt @@.girlVoice;super smart@@ for even thinking about the possibility.

The day had been full of opportunities to show how smart you were. Like when you&#39;d stacked those blocks &#39;&#39;super&#39;&#39; high. Or when you&#39;d correctly pointed out that the green balloon was bigger than the red balloon. Or when you&#39;d identified at least three different letters, even if one had just been a guess.

There was so much to learn and so much to do that you couldn&#39;t stand doing one thing for too long. Five minutes was best, ten if you really liked it. Sometimes you had to do something for a whole fifteen and that always made you impatient.

@@.girlThought;This is amazing.@@

You couldn&#39;t imagine why you ever would have been averse to any of it. Maybe really old people, like Kara&#39;s big sister, didn&#39;t find it fun to moo like a cow, but you did. You found almost everything fun, which sounded way more fun than thinking things were boring.

[[You loved daycare|Emily Low Happiness Ending 17-3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="580" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending 17-3" tags="" position="1225,7225" size="100,100">As much as you @@.girlVoice;missed mommy@@ you found yourself wishing the day would never end. You had @@.girlVoice;so many friends@@ and @@.girlVoice;so many toys@@ that you&#39;d be able to stay here &#39;&#39;forever&#39;&#39;.

Not that you really understood what &#39;forever&#39; was. Complex concepts like that were becoming foreign to you. You could understand some hard ones, like things being &#39;bigger&#39; or &#39;smaller&#39;. But then someone had asked you &#39;what day it was tomorrow&#39; and you couldn&#39;t even figure out what they meant.

There were lots of concepts that were becoming fuzzy. For example, one of the boys had found a slug in the yard, and tried showing it to everyone else. The girls had thought it was gross, while the boys thought it was cool. That was enough to make you believe that wholeheartedly that @@.girlVoice;boys were gross@@. That was simple enough.

But how were boys different from girls? You knew there was a difference. Boys were gross and liked slugs. Girls were nice and wore dresses. But if a girl liked a slug did that make her a boy? Or if a @@.girlVoice;gross boy@@ wore a dress were they not gross now? This seemed like something you should know, but you didn&#39;t. However, you felt your logic seemed sound, if a girl liked a @@.girlVoice;gross slug@@ then they&#39;d be a @@.girlVoice;gross boy@@. You&#39;d have to be super careful to not like anything gross.

Explaining this revelation to the other kids did nothing to clarify the matter, and the daycare workers said you&#39;d have to ask your mom about things like that.

[[The week continued|Emily Low Happiness Ending 18]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="581" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending 18" tags="" position="100,7350" size="100,100">It wasn&#39;t all @@.girlVoice;sunshine and rainbows@@. You grew more @@.girlVoice;easily scared@@ as the week progressed, finding yourself paralysed when things became overwhelming. Relying more and more on Emily and mom whenever a crisis arose. Like when you&#39;d @@.girlVoice;spilled juice on the floor@@, or when you @@.girlVoice;couldn&#39;t undo the button on your blouse@@, or when there was @@.girlVoice;a bug in your room@@. How were you supposed to deal with any of that on your own? At first it had bugged you, but now you preferred it when Emily or mom did hard things for you. It was usually too frustrating to do them yourself.

Strangers had taken on their own strange terror. When mom invited one of her witch friends over you had hidden behind mom the entire time. @@.girlThought;Witches are scary@@. Mom wasn&#39;t scary, but you didn&#39;t know about the rest.

You&#39;d told the other kids about how scary it was, but they all made fun of you. They said that witches weren&#39;t real and you were @@.girlVoice;dumb@@ for believing in them. You thought they were all dumb, but the daycare workers took their side. They said some magic was real, like @@.girlVoice;Santa Claus@@ and the @@.girlVoice;tooth fairy@@, but that @@.girlVoice;scary things@@ like witches and ghosts and goblins were only in story books.

You had enough awareness to know that you&#39;d been mixing up fantasy and reality a lot this week. But now you had confirmation from an adult, magic wasn&#39;t real and witches weren&#39;t real. This confused you more. You had this whole story in your head about how you used to be a boy. Why had you made that up? Did you used to like slugs and then you got better? 

You cried to mom about it when you got home that night. That you didn&#39;t want to like slugs, you didn&#39;t want any @@.girlVoice;scary witches@@ to get you. She didn&#39;t exactly understand what the trauma of liking slugs was, you&#39;d never explained that particular chain of logic. But she said you didn&#39;t need to worry about any of that, that @@.momVoice;&quot;Mommy will take care of everything for you&quot;@@.

Mom always took care of you. She made you food, and she washed you, and she helped you dress and she tied your shoes, you really couldn&#39;t do much without her around. That comforting thought carried you off to sleep, not knowing that Emily and mom were watching you from the door.

[[You dreamt|Emily Low Happiness Ending 19]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="582" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending 19" tags="" position="225,7350" size="100,100">As your slept your mind floated through all of the things that had happened over the course of the week. It was a jumble. Though you had a near complete memory of every moment, your feelings on the events varied wildly. 

For example the fact you were not able to dress yourself before bed. On the one hand it seemed entirely normal, @@.girlVoice;mommy@@ took care of things like that. You were only little, you&#39;d be able to do it when you got older.

But on the other hand you had a deep frustration at the fact. A bone deep knowledge that you //should// be able to do all of this. That something was wrong with your inability to tie your shoes or yours struggles with buttons. You should be bigger, stronger, more capable. You had memories of these things, but they seemed more like a story you&#39;d heard than something you&#39;d experienced first hand.

The dichotomy hadn&#39;t bothered you much during the day, but now that you were alone with your own mind it came to the fore. You hated it. You didn&#39;t want to feel this way, but it seemed like as long as you had these intrusive thoughts you&#39;d be stuck in this half way state. The question was, which ones were the errant thoughts? 

Were you a teenage boy? That all of these thoughts about relying on &#39;mommy&#39; were aberrant. That you should be able to write essays, not struggle to even write a single letter, and not knowing what it meant when you did. You should be a capable almost adult, not a helpless little girl barely out of diapers.

Or were you a little girl? It was entirely normal that you couldn&#39;t read or write, that shoelaces were an arcane mystery, and that slugs were @@.girlVoice;super gross@@. That you loved @@.girlVoice;princesses@@ and @@.girlVoice;ponies@@ and @@.girlVoice;mommy@@. You loved going to daycare every day and playing with all of your friends.

[[You woke|Emily Low Happiness Ending Escape 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="587" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending Escape 2" tags="" position="850,7350" size="100,100">By the time you awoke the previous days seemed almost a dream. You knew they had happened, but the shrinking of your mind meant that the memories had become fuzzy. No one remembered things before age 5 after all. Though the grins your @@.noFilter;mom@@ and sister gave you when you came downstairs that morning confirmed that it was all real.

It was almost strange to be back at regular high school, you kept having intrusive thoughts about how weird school was. That all of this was way too hard and you should go back to @@.girlVoice;coloring@@ or @@.girlVoice;playing with dolls@@ instead.

You persevered and the thoughts quieted down, but always seemed to be lurking in the background. After school on Friday Emily revealed why these @@.girlVoice;toddlerish@@ thoughts were still bouncing around in your head.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Welcome home baby sis,&quot;@@ Emily called as you came through the door.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Ha ha very fun-\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Your words cut out as your head swam. When you finally came back to your senses you @@.girlVoice;giggled@@ at the @@.girlVoice;silly feeling@@.

Emily just laughed, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;don&#39;t think too hard sis, it was a trick question. You&#39;re much too little for school aren&#39;t you?&quot;@@

You brightened, Emily&#39;s words having clarified the situation. Of course, you were @@.girlVoice;only three@@, you were way too young to be going to school. You nodded to Emily and she smiled back.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;I&#39;ve got some homework to do, why don&#39;t you play with your dollies?&quot;@@ 

She handed you your @@.girlVoice;favourite baby doll@@ and you grabbed it excitedly. It felt like you hadn&#39;t played with her in forever. The next twenty minutes were spent playing with your @@.girlVoice;dolly@@ on the floor while Emily finished her work. You didn&#39;t understand why, but she kept smiling whenever she looked at you. Maybe she wanted to play too?

@@.momVoice;&quot;Emily I&#39;m home and-oh!&quot;@@ she startled at your unexpected position on the floor, @@.momVoice;&quot;Emily, I see you wasted no time playing with your &#39;baby sister&#39;. Did you check she didn&#39;t have any homework of her own first, like we talked about?&quot;@@

Emily gave an embarrassed smile, clearly showing she hadn&#39;t. Mom sighed and snapped her fingers.

At first you thought you still had to be addled, considering the fact you were on the floor pretending to feed a baby doll. A few more moments and you realized that, as weird as it was, that was the current situation.

You stood, too dazed to actually put the doll down, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;What just happened?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Your mind ran back the last twenty minutes, playing with this doll as if it was the most natural thing in the world. You&#39;d been acting like...like you were three.

Mom explained the situation, @@.momVoice;&quot;sending you to daycare was proving too intensive. It was too difficult for your four year old mind to learn a lesson; as simple as the lesson should have been.&quot;@@

@@.momVoice;&quot;So I&#39;m making sure you have some time with your supposedly more mature brain to adjust your behaviour,&quot;@@ she continued, @@.momVoice;&quot;until then Emily can, at her discretion have some playtime with her &#39;baby sister&#39;.&quot;@@

But the rest of the time it&#39;ll be up to Emily whether you&#39;re playing video games or with dollies. Understand?&quot;@@

You nodded, not seeing any other way out of the situation. Emily just smiled, all sweetness and light, acting as the shining example of innocence and purity. You just glared at her. 

Luckily, in this case you actually did have homework to do, homework you intended to stretch out for as long as possible this weekend.

[[Time for homework|Emily Low Happiness Ending Escape 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="590" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending Escape 5" tags="" position="1225,7350" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;set $playerMaturity to 3&gt;&gt;\

Unfortunately mom saw directly through the ruse. As such you spent almost the entire weekend with the brain of a three year old girl. Emily explained that she wanted a proper @@.girlVoice;baby@@ sister, so you had to be three rather than four. Though at the time you were wholly focused on trying to draw a stick figure princess with crayons, so you didn&#39;t really understand. 

When you were altered it all seemed totally fine, it wasn&#39;t embarrassing at all to be a sixteen year old boy playing with dolls and doing finger painting. It was when you came back to your teenage senses that the shame burned your cheeks.

To you this didn&#39;t seem like an at all reasonable way to &#39;teach a lesson&#39;, but you couldn&#39;t deny the effectiveness. At first you tried to behave better just so you didn&#39;t end up forgetting how to read. However, over time you started to genuinely understand. You could see how frustrating it could be when you were bored, or stuck, or needed help and Emily was &#39;too busy&#39;. Just because the help you needed was something as simple as tying your shoes only made it more annoying when she didn&#39;t help. She could solve your problem in seconds, but refused to. It made her seem like a huge jerk, just like you had been.

So when you were of the right mind to be able to help her, you tried your best to be attentive. It didn&#39;t stop her from making you into a toddler every time she got annoyed with you, but she left you alone the rest of the time.

[[Learning your lesson|Emily Low Happiness Ending Escape 6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="591" name="Emily Low Happiness Ending Escape 6" tags="" position="100,7475" size="100,100">Even after mom said that you&#39;d &#39;learned your lesson&#39;, she left the trigger phrase. It had become a bit of a release valve in your relationship with Emily. It was hard to keep up a fight after you&#39;d lost a dozen years of mental capacity and the ability to properly use 50% of your now greatly reduced vocabulary.

Which was why you were now on the floor holding a pair of Barbie dolls and having them talk about their favourite princesses. The biggest thought now in your mind about how @@.girlVoice;overjoyed@@ you were that Emily had let you play with her @@.girlVoice;Barbies@@ like a @@.girlVoice;big girl@@. While Emily took a chance to cool off while enjoying the sight of her &#39;big brother&#39; acting like a toddler.

Some people might call the arrangement strange...okay it was strange...but what else could you expect when your mom and sister were witches? Your mom was happy that the two of you had stopped fighting, Emily was happy that you were treating her better than ever before, and you were happy that you could play with @@.girlVoice;your dollies@@ and no one would make fun of you. Not that you could ever admit that to //anyone//. It was too embarrassing to admit how much you loved slipping back into that toddler mindset. A world where even the silliest simplest thing could bring you abundant joy. No you&#39;d just keep pretending to be mean to Emily sometimes, get &#39;punished&#39;, and no one would be the wiser.

Kara, being her usual self, took her time to consider the possibilities. As the seconds ticked by you could see the impatience of the other girls. Then in a flash something came to her. She stared at you as if you were some alien species before blushing and looking away from you. It was a strange moment, but Kara was a strange girl. No real telling what was going on in her head. 

Nervously she looked at you one more time before nodding to herself. It seemed that she&#39;d reinforced her resolve regarding the decision. Beckoning your mom to lean down so Kara could whisper the request.

@@.momVoice;&quot;That&#39;s not something I can do,&quot;@@ she glanced at you and then dropped her voice so you couldn&#39;t hear. The two of them continued their conversation in a hushed whisper. The other girls seemed to be getting snippets of it, but you couldn&#39;t make out a thing.

Finally they leaned apart, @@.momVoice;&quot;Now that is something I can do,&quot;@@ her voice returning to normal audible levels. She turned to you, @@.momVoice;&quot;are you ready?&quot;@@

You shrugged, saying no wasn&#39;t going to change anything, and was it ever possible to be ready for something like this?

[[Weather the changes|Kara High Happiness Ending 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="593" name="Kara High Happiness Ending 2" tags="" position="350,7475" size="100,100">As the magic washed over you, sending tingles across your entire body it almost made you laugh. This was for two reasons. One, it was so strange how this feeling was becoming familiar to you. Two, it tickled. You weren&#39;t sure why it tickled this time when it hadn&#39;t before, but there you were, rapidly shrinking down and doing your best not to giggle uncontrollably. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &gt; 10&gt;&gt;You&#39;d never actually gotten too young before, but it seemed this time you shrinking way down.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;d gotten pretty young during the party and it seemed like you were heading that way again.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Everything played out as you would expect a transformation into a little girl to go. Your body shrank down, every part shrinking in lock step with each other. As your torso shrank so did your legs and arms, hands and feet. It wasn&#39;t long before your clothes were so baggy they were threatening to fall off. This seemed to trigger something in mom who waved her hands, altering the spell. Your clothes snapped to attention and began to keep up with the transformation. They were a little behind so things were still a bit loose, but at least you&#39;d be able to stay covered.

As much as you could, you tried to relax. It was only for a week after all, you didn&#39;t need to freak out that you were losing all your hard earned muscles. That you were rapidly becoming smooth and soft, the lack of body hair marking you as prepubescent. You just had to get through a week and all would be well. You could handle being four feet tall and fifty pounds, since all your classmates would be as well. As the changes began to slow you were settling around Kara&#39;s height. That wouldn&#39;t be so bad, Kara and you had gotten along fairly well, so you might even enjoy the time.

Only when you&#39;d finished shrinking down did you realize there was one major difference between this and your previous transformation. You certainly had become little, smooth and soft and delicate, but you weren&#39;t a girl. Your boy parts were...diminished...but they seemed proportionate for your new age category. Another minor indicator was the fact your hair hadn&#39;t gotten any longer. Between the short hair and the simplistic outfit it was pretty clear that you were a little //boy//.

Your continued masculine appearance proved to be a surprise amongst all the girls. Kara didn&#39;t look surprised, it had been her request after all, but she still seemed overwhelmed. The blush on her face had returned and she couldn&#39;t actually meet your eye.

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;Why doesn&#39;t &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; look like a girl? Is she still a boy?&quot;@@

@@.momVoice;&quot;On Kara&#39;s request &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; is still a boy. Though regressed to her age. So he&#39;ll be attending grade 2 alongside her this week.&quot;@@

The girls looked between one another, seeing if any of the others had an obvious explanation for the situation. None of them were able to work it out, and Kara wasn&#39;t forthcoming about the details of her wish, or why she&#39;d made it. It was a very curious situation, but at least you&#39;d have the entire week to figure it out.

That was assuming you&#39;d ever be able to get Kara to actually talk to you. Right now she wouldn&#39;t even look at you. Hopefully mom would be able to provide at least some explanation. 

Though for the remainder of the morning both were frustratingly tight lipped. Even when the other girls left mom still refused to tell you anything about the why of your form. She assured you that there would be no problem being in class for a week, and that she would ensure you had clothes to wear, but you were left ignorant of Kara&#39;s wish.

[[Time for school|Kara High Happiness Ending 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="595" name="Kara High Happiness Ending 4" tags="" position="600,7475" size="100,100">At least once you both got to class she was willing to talk to you again, though still not about your most burning question. She was more than happy to answer questions about school, or your peers or a dozen other things, but not that. It was nice to have a close friend in class though. Your seven year old body had come with a seven year old mind, which meant new situations with a bunch of strangers made you deeply uncomfortable. Emily&#39;s presence was also a boon. She seemed to know every single kid in the school by name and knowing her meant you were automatically part of the group.

Despite that you spent most of your time with Kara. She wasn&#39;t as popular as Emily, but she still had a small group of close friends. It wasn&#39;t a shock that they were the nerdier kids in class but it was unfamiliar crowd for you. You wouldn&#39;t say that you&#39;d been a &#39;jock&#39;, you didn&#39;t actually play on any sports teams. But you did spend a lot of time in the gym and certainly hadn&#39;t been one of the geeks. Though that was rapidly changing. With Kara&#39;s support you were rediscovering several &#39;nerdy&#39; interests you&#39;d had in the past. Comic books and science fiction and fantasy books as a start. You&#39;d even been willing to give chess a chance, though you were absolutely crushed by Kara in every single game. Somehow losing to her didn&#39;t feel as bad as you&#39;d expected, she was gracious in victory and always took it as a chance to teach you something. 

It was only a few days before you&#39;d truly integrated into the group, chatting away as if you&#39;d been doing this for years. Kara was experiencing a special joy in this, since you hadn&#39;t been a geek, you hadn&#39;t seen a lot of the geek staples. So she had a near endless supply of things to suggest to you. Movies, shows, books and more. Though some of the books were a struggle, Kara was a very advanced reader, while you were closer to the norm for grade 2. You spent a lot of evenings at her place, under the auspices of doing homework, but really just mostly watching tv or having her read to you.

In a flash you were done with the week, the weekend giving you even more time to hang with Kara, though this time she was at your house. There was a nervousness in the back of your mind, as much fun as you were having mom was likely to turn you back at any moment. Was there a way to keep enjoying this? It seemed unlikely. A sixteen year old hanging out with a seven year old would be more than odd, even if that seven year old was incredibly smart.

[[Dinner time|Kara High Happiness Ending 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="596" name="Kara High Happiness Ending 5" tags="" position="725,7475" size="100,100">Kara had to return home for dinner, and Emily was over at Sophie&#39;s, so it was just you and mom for dinner. It was a quiet affair. You weren&#39;t quite sure what you wanted to say and mom was giving you the time and space to figure it out. 

Finally, as mom was washing the dishes, you worked up the courage to speak. &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Mom. Since this is my last day like this, can you tell me now what exactly Kara wished for?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Mom paused her washing so she could focus her attention on you, @@.momVoice;&quot;you want to know that badly?&quot;@@ You nodded in response, @@.momVoice;&quot;and what exactly would you be willing to do to find that out?&quot;@@

You wracked your brain for possible incentives, but you were only seven, so your ideas were rather limited. To you they seemed rather dramatic, but it was hard to say if mom would agree.

[[I&#39;ll do the dishes for a week, no, a month.|Kara High Happiness Ending 6]]

At first you thought she was mocking you, but the laughter was light and seemingly genuine. @@.momVoice;&quot;Oh sweetie.&quot;@@ 

It annoyed you a bit when she called you that. You might be little, but you weren&#39;t a girl, so you didn&#39;t want to be called sweetie. But cutesy nicknames weren&#39;t the concern right now. &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;What if I did //all// of them?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; To you this seemed to be a grave suggestion, taking potentially infinite amounts of your time.

Her laughter abated but did not stop. @@.momVoice;&quot;I see you are very serious about this.&quot;@@ Looking at your adorable serious face she considered the situation, @@.momVoice;&quot;How about this? I&#39;ll only make you clean the dishes, but you have to stay seven for another week.&quot;@@

That one stopped you in your tracks. You&#39;d never even considered offering something like that. Partially because you&#39;d forgotten to add &#39;I&#39;ll be sixteen tomorrow&#39;, in your calculations. It was an interesting counter offer, doing the dishes wouldn&#39;t take terribly much time, and it was only a week more like this. Kara had a ton of stuff she still wanted to show you, so the week certainly wouldn&#39;t be boring.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Deal.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Both the speed of your response and the surety of it proved surprising to her. But a deal was a deal and she was a woman of her word.

[[Another week|Kara High Happiness Ending 7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="598" name="Kara High Happiness Ending 7" tags="" position="975,7475" size="100,100">Her //exact// words it seemed. She&#39;d agreed to tell you, but she hadn&#39;t agreed that it would be immediately. Still, you had to at least hold up your end of the bargain before she could ever tell you. Otherwise you might just take the information and then shirk your duties. So you were in for another week wallowing in ignorance. 

Your life continued much as it had in the previous week. At first you tried to convince yourself that the only reason you were staying this way was out of curiosity. This form was such a departure from everything else at the party it felt like there had to be some kind of greater purpose to it.

This reasoning didn&#39;t hold up for long. At the end of the week it was revealed that you had made a very poor deal. She&#39;d said she was tell you, but she&#39;d never specified when. If you turned back there would be no reason to tell you, so the only way she would ever tell you was if you stayed this way...and cleaned your room. You hastily agreed, not mentioning that Kara&#39;s mom had already offered to take the two of you to a movie next week, and you didn&#39;t want to miss it.

As the weeks went on even you had to admit that curiosity alone was not enough justification to have entirely abandoned your old life. Sure there wasn&#39;t terribly much to miss, you&#39;d had no close friends and weren&#39;t in any clubs or teams, but this was still an almost unthinkable life change. Yet you couldn&#39;t actually say you were disappointed. It was...nice. You&#39;d only been in Kara and Emily&#39;s class for a few weeks and you had more friends now than you&#39;d had in your years at high school.

Which meant you were almost overwhelmed by the number of people you could hang out with. Naturally you spent a good amount of time with Emily and the other girls. One of them came over basically every night. You also had time to spend with some of the other boys in your class. Still the bulk of your spare time was spent with Kara. The two of you had grown quite friendly during the sleepover, so it only seemed natural for it to continue, since you were actually peers now. Though you had to admit that she was smarter than you. You were decently clever, for a seven year old, but she was something else. Which meant at least some of her time was spent helping you with homework. You both enjoyed your study sessions, but it took a little bit to get over being taught by someone who used to be a decade younger than you.

[[The year continued on|Kara High Happiness Ending 8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="599" name="Kara High Happiness Ending 8" tags="" position="1100,7475" size="100,100">The rest of the year was full of the same joys that the first few weeks had been. Hanging with the girls, school with your friends, and lots of time with Kara. You never wanted this time to end, but time marches on, even for those who&#39;d been regressed to childhood. You couldn&#39;t stay seven, you wanted to stay the same as as Kara, but as you grew older certain changes became necessary. 

You&#39;d actually been invited to a few more sleepovers after your regression. They were still filled with sickeningly girly activities. But at least this time you knew that the girls painting your nails would make you look more like a girl, but wouldn&#39;t actually make you into a girl.

Eventually these had to stop. You were all reaching an age where boys and girls weren&#39;t allowed to sleepover at each other&#39;s houses anymore. It was...unseemly. Even beyond that you found yourself drifting away from the group. It wasn&#39;t that you disliked them or anything, but as you all pushed through childhood and were encroaching on teenagehood, your interests had diverged. Painting nails and doing makeup had never been your thing, but now it was painfully boring to even consider. So even when the sleepovers were at your house, you didn&#39;t really participate, and you were full on banned from Emily&#39;s room.

There was one notable exception. You&#39;d all gotten older and the girls had scurried off to Emily&#39;s room. You had no idea what they were doing, but you could hear them giggling over their loud music. Eventually you received a surprising knock on your door, opening it up to see Sophie grinning at you. Even now she was still taller than you, much to your chagrin, and she made sure you knew it.

At least on most days, today it seemed she was playing nice, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;Come to Emily&#39;s room. There&#39;s something you need to see.&quot;@@

You had no idea what she was referring to, but you had to at least check it out.

Finally they parted, revealing Kara standing behind them. Though it wasn&#39;t Kara as you&#39;d ever seen her before. She was pretty nerdy and most of her attention was spent on academics rather than fussing about her appearance.  But it seemed that at least part of this sleepover had been dedicated to makeovers and Kara had been the most obvious benefactor. 

She was wearing a knee length black dress with a slit on the side, combined with a set of black kitten heels. It was an outfit meant more for a formal dance than a casual sleepover, but a specific point was trying to be made. The girls had done an excellent job on her makeup. Subtle enough in most places that it hid imperfections, but you wouldn&#39;t notice it&#39;s existence. Except for her lipstick and eyeshadow, those were clearly meant to draw your eye. Similarly to the long necklace she was wearing which naturally drew your eye down to...

You quickly looked away scratching your head, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Oh Kara, I didn&#39;t know you were here,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; except you did know, and everyone knew you knew, you were just being awkward and nervous. You coughed and continued, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;you&#39;re dressed up so nicely, what&#39;s the occasion?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Nervously you looked back at her but it seemed that she was equally, if not more, embarrassed than you. You&#39;d thought they might have overdone the blush, but you quickly realized that it had come to her cheeks entirely naturally.

[[The two of you stood in silence|Kara High Happiness Ending 10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="601" name="Kara High Happiness Ending 10" tags="" position="100,7600" size="100,100">Miki giggled and Sophie grunted in frustration, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;you two are impossible.&quot;@@

Both you and Kara went beet red. You couldn&#39;t decide if you should be looking at her, or looking at Miki, or maybe just staring at the floor and running until you got back to safety...

But all of the girls were waiting for an answer and Kara did look very pretty, it&#39;d be rude not to at least say something. &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;You, uh...you look very pretty Kara, the dress suits you.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

That was all Kara could handle, she squeaked something that might have been a &#39;thanks&#39; and went to hide in Emily&#39;s closet.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;All right, show&#39;s over, get out of here. Us girls need to talk.&quot;@@ Sophie shooed you out of the room, but you were all too happy to go. Your room was calm and safe and didn&#39;t have the danger of Kara&#39;s...well...everything. It was stupid, the two of you had been friends for years, you&#39;d seen her nearly every day. So you&#39;d seen her grow from a child to a girl on the cusp of womanhood, but somehow your mind had never made the switch.

That had all changed now. Your heart was pounding in your chest and you couldn&#39;t get the image of her out of your head. Even when you went to sleep that night your dreams were filled with all the near romantic moments you&#39;d missed. The signs that Kara wasn&#39;t a little girl anymore and that your feelings about her couldn&#39;t exactly be called &#39;platonic&#39; anymore.

The idea of one of your simple study sessions or movie outings had suddenly taken on a whole different connotation. One that neither of you was quite ready to acknowledge, let alone act upon.

A school dance provided the perfect opportunity and it seemed the world was conspiring to make it happen. You normally didn&#39;t even go to these things, you didn&#39;t have a girlfriend and going alone seemed embarrassingly lame. This time however, everyone seemed to be going, all of your friends had dates and were constantly hounding you about who you were bringing. Little did you know but Kara was receiving the same treatment from her own friends.

Finally it came to a head the day before the dance, the two of you had bumped into each other &#39;accidentally&#39; in the hallway, suspiciously right beside a sign for the dance.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry...I didn&#39;t mean to...are you okay?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Your mind was whirring. Every time you spoke to Kara it seemed that you lost all ability for coherent conversation. Which is why these days you studied with other, less distracting, classmates.

But there was one question you still had, one you&#39;d never gotten an answer for all these years, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Kara. Why did you ask my mom to turn me into a little boy all those years ago?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Another long pause. You were re-evaluating everything that had happened in the intervening years. All the time you spent with Kara, how you&#39;d felt about her then, how you felt about her now, was that all from mom&#39;s magic?

Kara considered the matter. If she could give you another form for a week, what would it be? The two of you hadn&#39;t managed to get along at all during this party. Kara was generally a pretty nice girl, but she also had a shockingly devious mind, filled with sci-fi and fantasy. There was no telling what she&#39;d want you as. You would protest the situation, but with mom there, and on their side, there wasn&#39;t much you could do. Though having your fate in the hands of nerdy seven year old wasn&#39;t the most comfortable position.

Finally she seemed to come to a decision. Beckoning your mother to lean down and then whispering into her ear. No doubt Kara would be able to effectively explain specifically what she wanted. Though that level of detail might just mean you&#39;d end up even stranger.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Ah yes. I understand, I can make something like that happen.&quot;@@

Kara looked abashed when she looked away from your mother. She couldn&#39;t even meet your eye, despite what was about to happen. 

Your mother began to move her hands through an arcane gesture before you felt her power wash over you.

&lt;&lt;/silently&gt;&gt;\
As the magic washed over you, you knew you were in for something dramatic. You felt drenched in it, clinging to you before you&#39;d even started changing. It built until it felt like your whole body was saturated in magic, then you started to change. 

Your perspective dropped as you started to lose inches of height. You&#39;d expected to have to go back through puberty, but something was off. Sure you were getting shorter, but your weight seemed to be lagging behind. It wasn&#39;t like you had a specific set of rules for these things, and since you were both becoming a girl and getting younger at the same time, it complicated matters. Despite that, you had an inkling that your newfound boobs should have been gone by now. Little girls were just as flat as boys, so what was happening? Your fixation on this one particular sign of femininity was no doubt a result of your still unchanged mind, causing you to miss other important details.

Though maybe you had it all wrong. It wasn&#39;t like you had a little chart, &#39;what&#39;s the average cup size for a 14 year old mostly boy but some girl? How tall should I be and how much should I weigh as a 12 year old almost girl?&#39; Google would have a field day trying to work out the answer to those ones.

As it stood you were still a little taller than Sophie, though that was rapidly changing. Your chest wasn&#39;t the only spot where excess fat seemed to be stubbornly hanging on. Your stomach was the main offender, but every part of you had more heft than you&#39;d expected. Finally you&#39;d gotten down below Sophie&#39;s height. But there were still lumps on your chest, you were sure now that those should be gone. 

It was at this moment that you took stock of some of the other feelings in your body. You felt heavy. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt;= 15&gt;&gt;Last time your loss of physical maturity had come with a corresponding loss of mass. Ending up thinner and weaker seemed to be the end goal. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt;= 10&gt;&gt;By the time your changes had seriously progressed you&#39;d felt like you weighed nothing at all.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Not so this time. If anything you felt //heavier// than usual. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; That should be impossible, that much loss of height naturally dropped weight as well, but if your strength was dropping faster than you were shrinking...was Kara&#39;s change to make you really weak? It did make some sense. Her struggles with the physical activities were clear to all of you, maybe she wanted someone to outdo. Leaving you a feeble little girl could certainly achieve that.

[[The changes slowed|Kara Low Happiness Ending 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="609" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending 3" tags="" position="1100,7600" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt;\

Your height was beginning to stabilize, the changes coming to a close. It looked like you&#39;d end up somewhere around Kara and Emily&#39;s height. Which meant your former outfit was now pooling around your feet, only an oversized shirt remained, now a dress. You stepped gingerly out of the pile of clothes, the continued weighty sensation making it take more effort than you&#39;d expected. The odd sensations only continued when you felt an odd wobbling sensation from your stomach after you&#39;d stepped. Putting a hand to your stomach gave you your second clue as to what had happened. It was //way// bigger than it had been before, and extremely squishy. You couldn&#39;t quite see with your current outfit but you could feel the weight of your oversized belly pulling down.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;What is this?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Your words came out with a severe lisp. You chalked it up to your current level of stress.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Why is my stomach so big?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Again, a lisp. If anything it was worse this time. You could see Emily and Sophie trying to suppress their giggles.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Shut up! Why does my voice sound ridiculous?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; This was enough to set the two of them into fits of giggles.

You weren&#39;t sure if you were more concerned about your fat belly or your sudden speech impediment when a third concern entered the picture. Your vision @@.blurry-text1;started to get blurry. It was only a little at first@@ @@.blurry-text2;but it was getting worse by the second.@@ @@.blurry-text3;Quickly enough the other girls@@ @@.blurry-text4;were little more than a blur.@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;What&#39;s going on? Why can&#39;t I see?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

@@.karaVoice;&quot;Here. Take these.&quot;@@ @@.blurry-text4;A blur that sounded like Kara pushed something into your vision. Half blind you grabbed at it. You brought them close to your face, a pair of glasses, thick ones.@@ @@.blurry-text3;You slipped them on and the world@@ came back into focus. It took your eyes a moment to adjust to your new coke-bottle glasses.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Thanks.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Your voice didn&#39;t sound as grateful as your words implied. It didn&#39;t help that the glasses didn&#39;t seem to fit and kept @@.blurry-text3;falling down your nose.@@ @@.blurry-text4;So you couldn&#39;t see until@@ you pushed them back up.

With one crisis solved it was time to get back to the other two. But before you could speak your tongue found the source of your second concern. Probing your teeth revealed there was something attached to them.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Braces.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You stated flatly. Braces. Setting aside the question of why you had them, why in the world had they made the word impossible to say for anyone who had them? It was just like &#39;lisp&#39;; someone naming these things had a cruel sense of humour.

But you were starting to get a sense of what had happened to you. Which was the exact moment the mental changes washed over you.

[[Grit your teeth|Kara Low Happiness Ending 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="610" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending 4" tags="" position="1225,7600" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;set $endingTraitKaraNerdFriend7 to true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/silently&gt;&gt;\
Considering the first wave had made you into a fat, short sighted, metal mouthed little girl, you were uneasy about what might come next. Unlike the physical changes there was no real way to objectively determine what was happening to you.

Which made you suspicious of how normal things felt in the moments after the magic dissipated. You could feel that your mind had been regressed again, there were all manner of gaps in your knowledge and memory. But beyond that you seemed to be stunningly normal. No irrational fears, no clothing obsessions, no urge to bawl about how unfair this all was.

You doubted that was it. No doubt there was something else going on that you just couldn&#39;t detect yet. It&#39;d probably find some way to come up at the worst possible moment. But it did seem that everything was done, leaving you to grapple with the reality of your new situation.

You cast your gaze onto Kara, standing only a couple feet in front of you. Her expression was difficult to judge. It wasn&#39;t Emily&#39;s devilish glee or Sophie&#39;s smugness or Miki&#39;s exuberance. Kara was clearly happy with the result, but there were other emotions marring the purity of that happiness and competing for attention.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Kara,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you were doing your best pick words that wouldn&#39;t cause your lisp to show, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;what did you do to me?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; That was a dumb question, it was clear //what// she had done, it was the //why// that was more interesting. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt;= 10&gt;&gt;This form was radically different than what you&#39;d had before.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;This form seemed rather different than what you&#39;d been heading towards before.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Better question,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; why did English have so many words with &#39;s&#39; in them? &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;why did you make me like this?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; 

Kara looked away for a moment. Staring at the floor and not meeting your gaze. @@.karaVoice;&quot;I-uh...well you see I was thinking that maybe you could be...um...&quot;@@

You never seen Kara this much at a loss for words, but you were struck by a distracting secondary thought. Why wasn&#39;t this bothering you? When it had been happening you&#39;d been lamenting the changes to your body. Wondering why Kara would do something this cruel. But now your questions had come not from anger, but sheer curiosity. As alien and humiliating as this form should be, you were almost entirely calm.

[[Kara took a steadying breath|Kara Low Happiness Ending 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="611" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending 5" tags="" position="100,7725" size="100,100">@@.karaVoice;&quot;I didn&#39;t want this specifically. I just...&quot;@@ she trailed off again.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;Not that I want you to get made fun of!&quot;@@ She hurriedly added, her guilt getting to her, @@.karaVoice;&quot;I just wanted someone else like me...&quot;@@

It seemed that mom&#39;s magic had taken some liberties with your transformation. Making changes that Kara would have never dared to ask for. You doubted she would have been mean enough to actually ask for you to be given a @@.girlVoice;big jiggly belly@@.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll ask her to change you back right away.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Thats okay,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; the words were out of your mouth before you&#39;d even realized you were saying them. You&#39;d just been given an out to go back to normal and you were declining? Though as you looked at Kara, her face having lit up at your words, you knew why you&#39;d said it. As embarrassing as this form was, it was just a manifestation of the suffering Kara suffered every day at school. Perhaps that was over-talking it a bit, she just wanted another nerdy friend so that she wouldn&#39;t get teased as much.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;The deal was for a week. Mom is serious about the rules.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You weren&#39;t sure if that was strictly true, but your empathy had gotten the better of you. You just had to hope you wouldn&#39;t regret the decision.

But first things first, [[you needed a new outfit|Kara Low Happiness Ending 6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="612" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending 6" tags="" position="225,7725" size="100,100">You regretted the decision.

You&#39;d already gone through five different outfits and none of them had...how did Kara put it? They didn&#39;t &#39;suit your body type&#39;. Which was a nice way to say that the jean shorts you&#39;d just tried on gave you an extremely apparent muffin top. It wasn&#39;t that they didn&#39;t fit at all, Emily&#39;s closet apparently could even handle dramatic changes to a waistline, but they were deeply unflattering.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;No that isn&#39;t going to work.&quot;@@

The latest attempt had been a tank top and skirt combo. The tank top technically got over your belly, but it looked strained, and was uncomfortably tight. You lifted it to relieve the pressure, but then you just had your belly hanging out and that was enough to spike your anxiety. You hadn&#39;t been bothered at first, but you were starting to get @@.girlVoice;self concious@@ about how you looked. Nothing was even meant for a @@.girlVoice;girl your size@@...

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Maybe this was a mistake.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Emily just rolled her eyes and kept looking through her closet. @@.emilyVoice;&quot;I&#39;ve got it!&quot;@@ She half dove into her closet, pulling out a dress.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;But I&#39;ve already tried a dress,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; your voice came out whinier than expected.

Emily scoffed, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;And what would a boy know about dresses?&quot;@@

You could protest that you weren&#39;t exactly a boy at the moment, but that seemed a waste of time. So you dutifully took the dress and gave it a try.

Kara wasn&#39;t wrong, it definitely looked the best of anything so far, it was actually @@.girlVoice; pretty cute@@. No one was about to think you&#39;d lost a dozen pounds, but it at least looked like it fit, though you didn&#39;t really understand why.

You grimaced. It seemed that your dressup session wasn&#39;t anywhere near complete.

[[Fill out your wardrobe|Kara Low Happiness Ending 8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="614" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending 8" tags="" position="475,7725" size="100,100">It felt like it took a lifetime, but you&#39;d managed to finally get an outfit for every day of the upcoming week. Sophie hadn&#39;t been kidding about knowing a few things. Between Emily and her they were able to offer outfits that, on the face of it, would look awful on you, but actually looked great. It became a little bit of a competition as to who could find the best outfits. Kara and Miki served as the &#39;impartial&#39; judges. In the end you actually had more than seven to pick from, though you left that choice to the girls.

Some of the outfits tried to hide your extra pudge, while others just embraced it. You had vague concerns about the latter, what would the kids at school think? But you kept those concerns to yourself, it was ridiculous to let yourself worry about the jibes of a few elementary school kids.

Though the next day you found your confidence faltering as you were about to head out the door.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Why won&#39;t this hair...&quot;@@ your mom continued in vain to try and get your hair to stay straight.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Its okay mom, is fine.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You tried to wave the brush away.

In truth you just really wanted her to stop bugging you so that you could get on with your day. What was a bit of frizzy hair going to do? If people were going to make fun of you it wasn&#39;t going to be about that. They would have more than enough fodder if they wanted to go after you. Something you were getting increasingly nervous about. Children were cruel at the best of times, and you had several exploitable weaknesses. You wanted to say that you wouldn&#39;t be effected by the juvenile insults of children, but you couldn&#39;t be sure.

Even as you walked to school with Emily you could feel your anxiety growing. Mom had said all of the official stuff was taken care of, so being a temporary student was no trouble. But how were you going to get along with a bunch of seven and eight year olds you&#39;d never met? @@.girlThought;What if they&#39;re mean?@@ Maybe you could lean on Emily and Kara, but it was still @@.girlVoice;pretty scary@@.

What did they think of you? What were they planning? What would they say?

It seemed you&#39;d have to wait for the answer. The teacher kept a pretty tight rein on the class during the lesson, so there wasn&#39;t opportunity for teasing. It was also in this moment that the regression of your mind really hit home. The first lesson had been Math and you were learning to add two digit numbers. Something so trivial to you that you&#39;d forgotten it was something you&#39;d ever had to learn.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;You forgot to carry the one.&quot;@@ Kara&#39;s gentle voice interjected.

You&#39;d just forgotten the fact you had a seven year old mind to go with your seven year old body. And apparently it wasn&#39;t a mind that was as sharp as Kara&#39;s, since she&#39;d already finished the whole worksheet and you were barely half way. Then again, looking around the room, you were ahead of basically everyone else. Kara was just @@.girlVoice;super smart@@, you shouldn&#39;t compare yourself to her.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;This is really sad,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; right now you didn&#39;t really care about the lisp, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;a bunch of scared little boys picking on some girls because they&#39;re jealous the girls are smarter than them.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

If the most popular girl in class told all of her friends that you were a bully, then you were only one step away from being a pariah. Normally you&#39;d consider that sort of silent treatment to be cruel, but you had very little sympathy for bullies. If they wanted to rejoin normal relations, then they could stop being jerks.

It was something that the trio learned very quickly. By Wednesday they were at Kara&#39;s desk apologizing for what they&#39;d done. It was all you could do to not burst out laughing. Bullies always folded the second there were actually consequences to their actions. You dug into your lunch while they continued begging for forgiveness. 

This lunch was extra exciting because you&#39;d managed to sneak in a few extra cookies. Yes, all these extra cookies were how you&#39;d gotten this belly in the first place, but they were @@.girlVoice;so tasty@@.

You shook your head at the incorrect reasoning. You kept defaulting into thinking this was your normal state, that you&#39;d lived your whole life like this, and would continue living it indefinitely. Rationally you knew that wasn&#39;t the case, but you kept justifying situations as if it was. Mom was going to turn you into a boy at the end of the week. &#39;&#39;Back&#39;&#39; into a boy, you corrected.

[[The week went on|Kara Low Happiness Ending 15]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="621" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending 15" tags="" position="100,7850" size="100,100">With the bullies dealt with the rest of your week was rather pleasant. Mostly pleasant. On Wednesday night mom, having noticed your cookie sneaking habit, had hidden them out of reach. Which meant your lunches only had 1 cookie rather than a half dozen. It was disappointing, but you were usually able to trade other kids for a couple more treats. 

You just had to make sure that Emily didn&#39;t rat you out. You wouldn&#39;t want to get in trouble again about eating too much candy. Mom was trying to be more strict with that, she said you had to be on a diet. You weren&#39;t sure you wanted to diet. Giving up cookies just so you could have a little less tummy? That didn&#39;t seem like a fair deal at all...not that you&#39;d have to stick to a diet. Because this was only temporary...

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;And what are you two up to?&quot;@@

You gave a small squeak as Emily&#39;s voice suddenly emerged from behind you. How was your @@.girlVoice;big sis@@ //that// sneaky? You thought it must be magic, but she claimed it was just a natural talent.

Hurriedly you shoved the last cookie into your mouth, hoping Emily hadn&#39;t noticed it wasn&#39;t the one mom had packed.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;Not too much. I was just telling &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; about an anime convention next weekend.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;It sounds pretty fun. Do you think mom would let me go?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Emily looked like she was going to say something, thought better of it, and then restarted, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;You&#39;ll have to ask her. But if you&#39;re good for the next couple days I&#39;m sure she will.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Yes! Did you hear that Kara? I just gotta be good and I can come on Saturday and maybe even Sunday!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Emily gave an odd smile and let the two of you finish your lunch in peace.

[[The week came to a close|Kara Low Happiness Ending 16]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="622" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending 16" tags="" position="225,7850" size="100,100">With the school week done you had the whole weekend to enjoy yourself, and you took full advantage of it. You&#39;d spent a good amount of the week at Kara&#39;s house and Saturday was no exception. 

The two of you had grown a lot closer as the week went by. Though your mind was mostly untouched, other than the regression, there was one major alteration. You were a total geek. Obviously you looked the part, but your behaviour made it just as apparent.

On Monday Kara had given you a comic book to try out, @@.girlVoice;it was amazing@@, so amazing that you didn&#39;t want to stop reading it. Which is why your mother had to scold you about reading too late. An attempt the next night showed that the &#39;flashlight under the covers&#39; trick was still painfully obvious.

But comic books were just the start. Kara had all sorts of things to show you, each one leaving you more breathlessly excited than the last. Metaphorically breathless, asthma wasn&#39;t part of of your transformation. Mom wouldn&#39;t knowingly inflict you with a disease. Being overweight seemed to be where she drew the line.

So you found yourself plopped in front of a screen at least half of the time. Munching on some chips, or any snack that was handy, while you watched Kara&#39;s latest suggestion. Obviously anime had been the one to catch your eye at the moment, but that didn&#39;t mean two weeks from now you wouldn&#39;t be absolutely obsessed with Lord of the Rings.

Thus your Saturday had been spent almost entirely unmoving, your eyes glued to the latest adventures of Sailor Moon. Kara told you there were tons of seasons and it would take you weeks to get through them all. You couldn&#39;t wait. Unfortunately mom insisted you be home for dinner. That there was something important to discuss.

[[Head home|Kara Low Happiness Ending 17]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="623" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending 17" tags="" position="350,7850" size="100,100">So you waved your goodbyes and got yourself home. Sliding into your chair just under the wire.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Wash your hands before you eat.&quot;@@ Mom admonished. You blushed and did as you were told, doing your best to ignore Emily&#39;s smug look.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Did you enjoy your time at Kara&#39;s?&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Mmmhmm. Kara has a bunch of awesome stuff. The said that the would show me more next time I came over.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Mom and Emily glanced at one another, @@.momVoice;&quot;Isn&#39;t there something you should be asking about before you make more plans with Kara?&quot;@@

You pursed your lips before it came to you. You had almost forgotten something //very// important.

[[Ask about changing back|Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 1]]
[[Ask about the anime convention|Kara Low Happiness Ending Stay 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="624" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 1" tags="" position="475,7850" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Right, the week is almost over. I guess I should ask to be turned back.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; The melancholy was obvious in your voice. You did want to get back to being yourself, but it was complicated. You wanted to go to the convention, wanted to continue enjoying comics and anime with Kara. Despite your initial derision of the mere idea, you actually kind of liked being a nerd.

Going back to your &#39;normal&#39; self it felt like you&#39;d have to give that all up. If nothing else you weren&#39;t really smart enough to hang with that crowd. Even if you were the damage it would do to your image sounded unbearable. You weren&#39;t like Kara, you didn&#39;t have dedicated friends to fall back on. If you slipped on the social ladder there would be no one there to catch you. Spending the rest of high school eating lunch alone in the bathroom wasn&#39;t an appealing thought

Your hesitation was obvious enough that even Emily realized your concerns. She&#39;d seen how well the two of you had gotten along this week. It would be a terrible shame to throw that away. Doubly so when Emily had never seen you as excited about something as you were about this convention. You&#39;d discovered a whole new world and you wanted to dive in with both feet, but you had too many hang ups.

You wished there was a way to keep pursing these new interests without drawing too much attention. You didn&#39;t need, or even want, to be loud and proud about it all. Just quietly enjoy them and slip under the radar, that was the ideal.

Your mother was even more perceptive than your sister. She understood your concerns even before you&#39;d voiced them in your own head. You&#39;d never been happier than this week as a geeky little girl, yet you didn&#39;t want to give up your old life. She had just the idea.

[[Mom made an offer|Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="625" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 2" tags="" position="600,7850" size="100,100">@@.momVoice;&quot;Well you don&#39;t have to go completely back to the way you were.&quot;@@

You waited for your mother to continue.

@@.momVoice;&quot;After the sleepover your body is a bit...flexible. I can make you a teenager again, but it&#39;s possible for you to make some changes to yourself in the process.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;What sort of changes exactly?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Mom considered that for a moment, @@.momVoice;&quot;well it&#39;d have to be mostly within human bounds. You could make yourself stronger, but you aren&#39;t going to be lifting a truck. You could even make yourself smarter.&quot;@@

The ability to make such changes raised a question of why she hadn&#39;t made this offer before now. You&#39;d been struggling with school for a while, getting a mental boost would have made things a heck of a lot easier.

@@.momVoice;&quot;All you have to do is hold an image in your head of the kind of person you want to be, the more specific the better. This situation is unique, it won&#39;t come up again, you only get one attempt.&quot;@@

@@.momVoice;&quot;Ready?&quot;@@

You hadn&#39;t expected it to be right now, but you supposed there was no reason to wait.

[[Consider your form|Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="626" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 3" tags="" position="725,7850" size="100,100">If you could choose to change yourself in any way what did you want to do? Obviously mom had been driving at the possibility of you making yourself more, for lack of a better word, nerdy. Maybe nothing quite as obvious as you currently were, but someone who was more able to keep enjoying your newfound interests.

You held an image of your old self. Your current form might be a basis for some of this, but you didn&#39;t want it to influence you //too// much.

You&#39;d need to be smarter of course. It wasn&#39;t a requirement to be smart to be a nerd, but if you were making changes no way you weren&#39;t going to take a boost. Maybe a fast reader, would let you churn through all those light novels much quicker.

Could you make yourself nicer? Was that even an option? You knew it was a choice certainly, but maybe you could change your bent. Make it more natural to be sweet to other people. Would you have to be quieter too? It&#39;d been fun to be a bit more boisterous this week, but you didn&#39;t really want to draw that much attention.

Right, you didn&#39;t want to be some loud and obvious geek annoying everyone else. You just wanted to fly under the radar, sit in the corner reading your manga in peace.

But how could you keep all of this in your head all at once? Thinking about all the things you wanted to do with your head was making you not think about how you&#39;d look.

[[Focus|Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="627" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 4" tags="" position="850,7850" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/KaraLow/Kotomi1.webp&#39; &quot;topRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\
You smiled to yourself, realizing that your description was //very// similar to a girl in one of the anime you&#39;d just seen. Kara had shown you a romance anime called Clannad. It wasn&#39;t your usual fare, but for some reason it had caught your attention and you&#39;d watched a ton of it. There were a bunch of different girls but right now you were half describing Kotomi.

Super smart girl, so smart that she didn&#39;t even have to go to class or anything because it&#39;d be a waste of her time. Instead she spent most of her time library just reading whatever she felt like. At first you&#39;d thought she was anti-social, but it turned out that she was just really shy. Once she opened up she turned out to be one of the nicest and sweetest characters in the whole show.

She was also pretty funny, if unintentionally. Her violin playing was literally ear bleedingly bad and she had a complete and total inability to tell jokes. However, that just made her all the more endearing because she was so earnest about it. She wasn&#39;t annoying or trying to be a pain, she was just a bit dreamy and adorably awkward.

You actually really liked her character. You didn&#39;t think you wanted to //be// her, but you did have to admit she was closer to your desired form than you expected. Even the purple hair was kind of neat, just something quirky and fun without really causing too much fuss...though you&#39;d never really figured out why she liked being barefoot at the time. Maybe it was just because she considered the library to be like home?

@@.momVoice;&quot;Here we go.&quot;@@ Your mother intoned, starting to cast the spell.

You snapped back to reality. Why had she started casting the spell? Was there a time limit? Or did she think you&#39;d already made your decision? Yes you&#39;d been thinking a lot about Kotomi, but that didn&#39;t mean...you tried to turn your mind elsewhere, to a different form, but you kept drifting back. You&#39;d thought she was so @@.girlVoice;cute@@ from the first time you&#39;d seen her, wishing you could be like that...

[[The magic washed over you|Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="628" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 5" tags="" position="975,7850" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/KaraLow/Kotomi2.jpeg&#39; &quot;topRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\
You made one last small attempt to form a new image in your head, but you didn&#39;t have your heart in it. If mom had asked you, you never would have said &quot;like this bookworm anime girl&quot;, but it felt right to you.

So when your eyes cleared and you looked down at your new form, you weren&#39;t really all that surprised. In contrast your mom and Emily looked entirely shocked by what had happened. They&#39;d expected changes but they hadn&#39;t quite expected //that// many changes.

You could understand their shock; your purple-blue hair and purple eyes were rather striking. They probably wouldn&#39;t be the first ones to stare at them, but hair dye and colored contacts were common enough. People would probably just think you were a bit quirky.

Something they would be completely right about. You weren&#39;t a clone of Kotomi or anything, but you could feel that you&#39;d picked up a few of her quirks. Even now you were thinking about how much you&#39;d rather be in the library than in this awkward conversation. Though you&#39;d also picked up at least some of her intellect, your mind felt like it was moving a mile a minute.

Not that a quick mind made it any more obvious what you should say. Despite knowing this was all real you moved your hands to hold your own @@.girlVoice;smooth@@ face before giving them a pinch.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Owww,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you exclaimed at the surprising pain. You were a bit more delicate than you&#39;d expected, both your body and your voice. It was @@.girlVoice;soft@@, @@.girlVoice;quiet@@ and slightly breathy. It sounded almost like you were out of practice at speaking and still getting comfortable with it. You weren&#39;t even sure you could yell with a voice like this.

@@.momVoice;&quot;You might need to explain this.&quot;@@

This had been the form you&#39;d been thinking of. Unintentionally to start with, but not unwanted.

@@.momVoice;&quot;So this is the form you want?&quot;@@

You nodded.

@@.momVoice;&quot;I think you look lovely,&quot;@@ she switched into full supportive mother mode, @@.momVoice;&quot;a bold choice with the hair, but I think it suits you.&quot;@@

What ensued was a quick conversation about the mechanics of what happened next. She&#39;d craft a charm so no one would think your new appearance was different than before, and then she&#39;d take care of making sure all the relevant documentation was up to date.

@@.momVoice;&quot;So you&#39;ll go by $girlName from now on?&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;No...Kotomi, I want to be called Kotomi.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; After all she was who you wanted to be, it felt only natural to share her name. Plus almost no one would know the reference. Except Kara, she&#39;d know //exactly// what had happened and who you looked like.

The conversation over you retired to your room for a few moments, exhausted from the day.

[[Look at yourself|Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 7]]
&lt;&lt;set $girlName to &quot;Kotomi&quot;&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="630" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 7" tags="" position="1225,7850" size="100,100">As focused as you&#39;d been on the changes to your mind you hadn&#39;t really gotten too much chance to look at your body. You weren&#39;t exactly sure how anime proportions would translate into real life.

Luckily nothing too unusual would give away the origin. Your eyes were a little larger than average, but you doubted anyone would really notice that. They&#39;d be to focused on the fact they were purple. You knew only albinos could actually have violet eyes like this, but maybe you could twist the story a bit. You weren&#39;t actually sure //why// you knew that, another perk of your genius brain.

The purple hair was easy enough to wave off as dye. Though you were going to need an intensive routine to take care of it, it was quite a bit of hair.

Past that you seemed like a fairly normal girl. You were small and slim, and smooth and soft and everything you would expect from a girl. You skin had a hint of tan to it which definitely hinted at Japanese heritage, but not enough that you&#39;d be blatantly unrelated to your mother. There was one thing you&#39;d certainly inherited from your mother. The next focus after your eyes...at least for men.

You cradled your new heavy breasts in your hand. You&#39;d known that Kotomi was pretty well endowed, they&#39;d even teased her about it in the show. But having them hanging off of your own chest was a different experience entirely. You didn&#39;t even know what size they were, but bras were clearly going to be a necessity to prevent back aches.

Not that the rest of you wouldn&#39;t garner it&#39;s own attention. Your narrow waist only made your wide hips even more noticeable. You hadn&#39;t thought about it at the time but she did have quite the hourglass figure and now you did as well. At least your butt wasn&#39;t //too// big. You didn&#39;t want to deal with //another// jiggly bit.

[[Back to school|Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="631" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 8" tags="" position="100,7975" size="100,100">Your first day back confirmed your suspicions about your figure. Mom had made sure that no one would be shocked that $playerName was suddenly a cute girl. But that didn&#39;t mean they wouldn&#39;t be &#39;&#39;very&#39;&#39; interested in a cute girl.

If you had a dollar for every time you heard a variant, &quot;I don&#39;t know how I haven&#39;t noticed you before&quot;, that day you&#39;d have been able to buy a library all your own.

The actual school library was somewhat disappointing, but it did provide a respite from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the school. You ate your lunch there, which some people might have said was &#39;sad&#39;, but you couldn&#39;t have been more content. Curling up in a corner with a good book, removing socks and shoes and just getting comfy. You didn&#39;t even want to go back to class.

But you did, you weren&#39;t about to start ditching class on your &#39;first&#39; day. Though it was a continued temptation throughout the week. Class was just so boring now. You&#39;d thought being a genius would make class great, but when you already knew everything you didn&#39;t even know why you were even there.

In time you might be able to get the same deal as your namesake, doing &#39;independent study&#39; in the library instead of having to go to useless classes.

Luckily your evenings were far more stimulating. Kara still had oodles of anime to show you which, unlike manga, had a consistent rate of consumption, so you wouldn&#39;t accidentally rush through them. You also took to volunteering at the public library on weekends. Somewhere, it turned out, Kara frequented herself. You didn&#39;t actually want to do much work, but it gave you access to every book there whenever you wanted, so it was a fair trade.

[[Life continued|Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 9]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="632" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending Change Back 9" tags="" position="225,7975" size="100,100">Your life continued on quietly from there, spending as much of your day reading as possible. You still were social at times of course. Spending time with Kara when you could, and your relationship with Emily was much improved. It turned out that having a genius for an older sister meant she&#39;d learn at home in ten minutes what took a whole class at school.

Your own marks of course went through the roof. If you weren&#39;t top of the school in a given subject, you were only a point or two back. You didn&#39;t even have to try hard. Though that fact was something you kept to yourself, you already got enough attention from being smart, you didn&#39;t want even more.

You became the go to for teachers to call on, knowing that, even if you were looking dreamily out the window, you&#39;d still have the answer. The boys also continued their incessant calls on you. No matter what you wore you couldn&#39;t really hide your figure and even if you did your eyes alone were apparently &#39;captivating&#39;...except their own eyes always glided back down towards your ample chest.

You had no interest in them. It wasn&#39;t that you &#39;didn&#39;t like&#39; boys, it&#39;s just that none of them were worth your time. Maybe in University you&#39;d find some who weren&#39;t just drooling over your body and actually stimulated you intellectually. Or maybe not. Boys, girls, or whatever, you weren&#39;t really interested in relationships right now. There were still so many books left to read...which reminded you a new batch was coming in today...you wondered if anyone would notice if you stayed at the library overnight...

@@.momVoice;&quot;Shhhh. Don&#39;t be too loud. &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; is at a very fragile point. It&#39;s best to not address the situation for a bit and let her act as she wants. A few days and she won&#39;t even believe you if you told her she&#39;d been a boy.&quot;@@

It transpired that you had cleaned it, kinda. You&#39;d missed a bunch, but it was enough to satisfy mom. She agreed that, as long as you were good this week, you could go to the convention with Kara.

You whooped and were practically vibrating with excitement. You&#39;d never got to go to a convention. The best you had was watching anime on tv. Which gave you another thought.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Could I maybe redecorate my room? It feels like a boy&#39;s room. I mean is not the worst, but I don&#39;t like it anymore.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

@@.momVoice;&quot;Of course sweetie. But let&#39;s get through that convention first, okay?&quot;@@

You quickly agreed to that deal. Chomping at the bit to tell Kara the good news.

[[The next week|Kara Low Happiness Ending Stay 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="637" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending Stay 5" tags="" position="850,7975" size="100,100">The idea that you should have been attending high school and not grade school never even crossed your mind. You were working away subtraction with two digit numbers and learning about verbs, as happy as could be. Your enthusiasm for school did dampen as the week went on. You liked math, but no one enjoys grinding away at Math questions forever. You just wanted school to be done so that you could go to the convention with Kara.

Finally, mercifully, the week did end and you were allowed to go. Mom had given you a whole bunch of instructions. What to do if you got lost. Not to leave the group. On and on and on...you didn&#39;t want all these rules, you just wanted to go.

Eventually you were allowed your freedom. Mom thanked Kara&#39;s mom for taking on the task. You weren&#39;t aware of it, but the relevant people had been briefed on the situation. So the sudden presence of a seven year old girl, where a sixteen year old boy had been. didn&#39;t cause undue distress. But you were too busy planning the day with Kara to notice any of that.

Emily had been invited as well but she&#39;d declined, as you&#39;d expected. She was nice enough about you enjoying it, but it wasn&#39;t her thing. That was fine. This could be something just you and Kara shared. The two of you even held hands as you walked through to doors to your very first anime convention.

You and Kara attended countless conventions. Not all of them were anime, there were comic books and games and all sorts of stuff. Some people may have decried it all as &#39;boy stuff&#39;, but they just didn&#39;t understand. Sailor Moon wasn&#39;t &#39;boy stuff&#39;, My Little Pony wasn&#39;t &#39;boy stuff&#39;. Though that sort of commentary never bothered either of you. &lt;&lt;if $getAwayBreakResult !== 0&gt;&gt;Mom once even let you turn back into a catgirl as a &#39;costume&#39;.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Even as you both grew older you continued to attend, your moms taking on the role of chaperone until you were finally old enough to go on your own to a small local expo.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Is the bow sitting right? I can&#39;t see it.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Kara cast you a quick glance, @@.karaVoice;&quot;It&#39;s fine. You know it&#39;s fine, you worry too much.&quot;@@ Her shortness wasn&#39;t annoyance, she was just concentrating on finishing her own costume.

At your first cons the two of you had just gone in themed outfits, then simple costumes and now the two of you were making them from scratch. Kara turned out to be quite the talented costume maker. Then again Kara was quite talented and successful at anything she put her mind to. You were no slouch academically, but Kara was on a whole other level.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;You&#39;re one to talk. You&#39;ve resewn that button three times, and it was right the first time.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Kara huffed and finished her work. It was important that both of your costumes were perfect, you were entering the Masquerade competition for the first time. As newcomers it was unlikely you&#39;d be able to win, even at the Novice level, but with Kara in charge of costume design anything was possible.

[[She up finished the costume|Kara Low Happiness Ending Stay 7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="639" name="Kara Low Happiness Ending Stay 7" tags="" position="1100,7975" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/KaraLow/ChibiMoonOutfit.webp&#39; &quot;smallTopRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I&#39;ve told you a dozen times, I&#39;m fine. You worry too much.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You smirked at throwing her words back at her, but you knew it was just because she cared. Though you weren&#39;t quite as chubby as you were when you were little, you didn&#39;t exactly have a flat stomach. There were plenty of people out there who seemed to make it their mission to tear down anyone who &#39;wasn&#39;t the right shape&#39; for a specific character. Now a good chunk of them were boys who wore maid outfits, but hypocrisy was nothing new.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I look fabulous. Not my fault if some people are too blind to see it.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Though you still had the tummy you&#39;d managed to shed some of your other...questionable features. The braces had finally come off. Leaving you with both straight teeth and the ability to say &#39;s&#39; sounds. You still wore glasses when you wanted to be comfy, but contacts gave you plenty of extra options on con days. You weren&#39;t going to get reddish eyes like this naturally.

&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/KaraLow/SailorMoonOutfit.webp&#39; &quot;smallMiddleLeft&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Kara got herself dressed so that the two of you matched. A pair of eager Sailor Scouts. You&#39;d gotten Sailor Mini Moon while Kara had gotten Sailor Moon herself. You&#39;d wanted that role, but as the one doing most of the work on the outfits, she got first pick. It was fine though, even if pink wasn&#39;t your favourite color, the outfit was still @@.girlVoice;super cute@@.

Kara offered you a hand. You&#39;d walked hand in hand to your first con and you&#39;d agreed to do the same to this one. Of course it was a lot more embarrassing to do it now, but you figured the whole &#39;sisterly&#39; vibe that came with the outfits would cover for you.

But the Masquerade wasn&#39;t until late in the evening. You had a whole day of activities to enjoy first. As you crossed the threshold you were tempted to break into a run to see everything faster. From Kara&#39;s smile she felt the same. The day passed in a flash and the two of you were backstage, about to be called.

Miki considered the matter. The two of you had actually become fairly close during the party. This would come as a double edged sword. On the positive side she was unlikely to be vindictive and saddle you with a terrible form. However, it also meant that she&#39;d want to keep playing with you, probably at something closer to her age.

Finally she came to a decision. Beckoning your mother to lean down and then whispering into her ear. It seemed like Miki only whispered a few words.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Ah yes. I understand, I think you would both enjoy that.&quot;@@

Miki looked extremely excited. Clearly she hadn&#39;t given complex instructions. But your mother had an uncanny ability to detect surface thoughts. Pure thought explaining things that Miki&#39;s limited vocabulary couldn&#39;t.

Your mother began to move her hands through an arcane gesture and you felt her power wash over you.

[[Weather the changes|Miki High Happiness Ending 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="641" name="Miki High Happiness Ending 2" tags="" position="100,8100" size="100,100">From the moment the magic touched you, you were gripped with an uncomfortable sense of wrongness. Something about your body was fundamentally wrong, to the point that you felt like you wanted to escape it. At first you thought that the changes had caused it, but you couldn&#39;t even detect anything different. Certainly nothing that should cause such a visceral reaction. Though you only had a moment to consider that before the changes began in earnest.

You were overwhelmed by a sense of vertigo as the ground suddenly got much closer to you. You&#39;d lost probably two feet of height in a moment, so the fact you recovered so quickly was the real surprise. At least things felt a lot more natural looking from this angle. The loss in height was accompanied by the shortening of not only your legs and torso, but also of your arms.

You looked at your short arms, grimacing at how they looked. Then from the tip of your fingers you saw something odd, there was a darkening of your skin. It wasn&#39;t extreme, but it was readily apparent. It travelled from your fingers, all the way up your hand, slowing as it crawled up the entirety of your arm. You couldn&#39;t see, but you could feel the tingles continuing to travel across your body, no doubt changing the rest of your skin. Looking at your beige skinned arms you breathed a sigh of relief, you felt much more comfortable now.

Now you were about the right size, but there were still more changes to come. That sense of wrongness had abated, but it was still there, clawing at your mind. It wasn&#39;t something you&#39;d be able to live with much longer, so you had to hope that it would fade away soon.

[[The changes continued|Miki High Happiness Ending 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="642" name="Miki High Happiness Ending 3" tags="" position="225,8100" size="100,100">Currently stuck as a weird little boy the magic continued to work over you. It was a subtle thing, but you could feel parts of you getting a little softer, a little smoother. It wouldn&#39;t be something terribly noticeable until you got a bit older, then no one would ever think you could be a @@.girlVoice;smelly boy@@.

The magic saw not only to your physical form but also to your clothes. Everything had almost fallen off of you but the magic caught them at the last moment. Shrinking them down to an appropriate size, but they didn&#39;t stay as jeans and a t-shirt. The shirt grew longer and thinner, a gentle pink starting to bleed into the formerly white fabric. It began bunching up in places but those quickly settled into gentle ruffles. The pink had continued to spread, now leaving your blouse a @@.girlVoice;bright pink@@.

Your pants were undergoing a somewhat more complicated transformation. Part of it pulling tight to your leg, while another piece near the top started to become looser. The tightening part continued to pull itself tauter to your skin, all the while the fabric was thinning and becoming more porous. At the same time all the color seemed to be draining from it, leaving it a pale blue. That extra coloration seemed to flow into the loose part. Though it kept tight around your waist the rest had separated from your legs, joining together into a single nearly black piece. Your stockings finished their transformation, such a pale grey that it was almost white. Meanwhile your black skirt had flowed down to just above your knees, adding a @@.girlVoice;cute little extra ruffle layer@@ before it settled.

As this occurred some very odd blond hairs fell in front of your eyes. It was so peculiar, you took hold of a few strands to take a look. But by the time you&#39;d blinked and been able to focus it was it&#39;s normal dark black. You let it go, only feeling a small tug as a pair of pink bows materialized, pulling your hair back into @@.girlVoice;cute pigtails@@. A few extra details faded in, a silver bow on the chest, patterning on your stockings, which finished the look. Now you were back in the outfit you&#39;d come in. Honestly you weren&#39;t sure why&#39;d you&#39;d had to change back. Why would you have ever been wearing @@.girlVoice;boring boy clothes@@?

[[The changes finished|Miki High Happiness Ending 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="643" name="Miki High Happiness Ending 4" tags="" position="350,8100" size="100,100">Your former strange outfit wasn&#39;t the only oddity that was bouncing around in your head. There were a lot of confusing contradictory thoughts that were making your head hurt. You remembered coming to the party, but then you also remembered having already been here? Emily was mad at you, but why would Emily be mad at you? The two of you were best friends. There were also thoughts of all these people you didn&#39;t think you knew, teenagers you had no reason to ever encounter.

The pain was coming to a head when it suddenly stopped. You relaxed, the headache fading away. You felt much better now, that sense of wrongness had almost entirely faded. Though it was even less clear why&#39;d you&#39;d ever felt that way at all. It wasn&#39;t like you were wearing anything weird or uncomfortable. You were just normal self.

Awkwardly you gripped at the side of your skirt, shifting in place, trying to make yourself feel better. There was still something small bugging you, some little note gnawing at the back of your mind, but you couldn&#39;t place what it was.

Suddenly there was a pinching around your @@.girlVoice;down there bits@@. It only lasted a moment but with it came a final sense of relief washing over you. Whatever had just happened had fixed that one last concern. Which meant you shouldn&#39;t just be here standing around, you should get @@.girlVoice;back to playing@@. The party was only going to be a little longer and you&#39;d have to go home.

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;You said he was stupid!&quot;@@ Emily grinned, but you thought better of your answer. It hadn&#39;t been quite like that, @@.mikiVoice;&quot;you said he wasn&#39;t as smart as he thought he was.&quot;@@

Emily&#39;s grin faded. The girls continued their impromptu interrogation regarding the most minute details of your life. But both you and the other you were able to answer every question. Even answering at the same time on more than one occasion. The one time you hadn&#39;t been able to answer something, the other you couldn&#39;t either. You&#39;d both forgotten the details of that particular event.

[[They gave up the attempt|Miki High Happiness Ending 8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="647" name="Miki High Happiness Ending 8" tags="" position="850,8100" size="100,100">@@.karaVoice;&quot;Darn! I thought that would work. It always works in the comics.&quot;@@

Emily&#39;s mom redoubled her focus, staring at the two of you as if she could see into your very souls.

Despondent from failing to figure out the situation she was in desperate need of cheering up, and you and other you had the best idea...

There were two Mikis, each of you insistent they were the real one. Each of you not understanding why this was a big deal, now you had someone you could always play with.

But it was not to be. As the minutes and hours had ticked by it came time for your mom to come pick you up. It was then that you realized the issue. Mom would expect to pick up you, not you and another you. It&#39;d be confusing and more than a little scary.

Which just so happened to be same concerns that Emily&#39;s mom was experiencing. She&#39;d run every test she could think of and Miki&#39;s mom was about to arrive and find she now had two copies of her daughter. Explaining that one would be a herculean task. So she did the next best thing, avoided it.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Miki,&quot;@@ the two of you looked and she grimaced.

Now you were torn. Going home was nice, but playing with Emily sounded nice too. Unfortunately there was no time to consider your position. Emily had pulled the other Miki away and Emily&#39;s mom was shepherding you to the door.

[[Time to go home|Miki High Happiness Ending 10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="650" name="Miki High Happiness Ending 10" tags="" position="1225,8100" size="100,100">@@.momVoice;&quot;Now Miki,&quot;@@ at least now it was clear who she was talking to, @@.momVoice;&quot;you&#39;re going to keep your promise about not telling, right?

You nodded, you&#39;d made the deal and you weren&#39;t about to go back on it. But did that mean the other you was actually $playerName? You were sure that you hadn&#39;t been a teenage boy yesterday, but the other you had seemed pretty convinced as well.

Again you weren&#39;t given a chance to really dive into this conundrum. Mom was here and it was time to go home. You held her hand as she walked you to the car. Thanking Emily&#39;s mom for hosting and taking care of you. You only resented that a little bit, you were a @@.girlVoice;big girl@@, you didn&#39;t need to be &#39;taken care of&#39;. But mom often thought that you needed more care and attention than you knew you did.

The car ride was quick, you didn&#39;t live too far away, but you were still @@.girlVoice;growing impatient@@. You hadn&#39;t thought about it until now, but without the party to distract you, you&#39;d gotten homesick. It&#39;d only been a night, but it felt like an eternity. Even if it meant dealing with your @@.girlVoice;meanie@@ older brother. You really didn&#39;t get along with him. The only nice thing he&#39;d ever done for you was being the one who introduced you to Emily, and that was only by accident.

Finally stepping through the threshold to your home you were struck by a second realization. You were @@.girlVoice;really tired@@. None of you had gotten much sleep, and the day had been rather eventful. You&#39;d only just gotten to your room and started unpacking when the fatigue became overwhelming and you crashed face down on your bed for an impromptu nap.

[[Time to wake up|Miki High Happiness Ending 11]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="651" name="Miki High Happiness Ending 11" tags="" position="100,8225" size="100,100">@@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;Time to get up sweetie. It&#39;s time for dinner.&quot;@@

You woke up with a start. You hadn&#39;t meant to fall asleep, so being woken up was a surprise. But mom was always so nice that you didn&#39;t really mind it. You nodded and got yourself up. Yawning you noticed that all of your luggage had already been unpacked and put away. Mom&#39;s handiwork no doubt.

The rest of the night wasn&#39;t worth talking about. It played out like a hundred other nights had. You dreaded the next day, but that was entirely normal. You didn&#39;t really like school and Monday&#39;s were the worst.

The night came and went and the school day was upon you. It to was basically the same as always. The only strange thing was that Emily seemed to be a little off kilter when you saw her at lunch. She invited you to come over to her place after school, though she wouldn&#39;t specify why. The whole thing sounded more like an order than a request. When you got there the other you met you at the door. 

The two of you were able to have some fun for the remainder of the evening. Though some of that was marred by Emily&#39;s mom&#39;s insistence on asking all sorts of weird questions and doing all sorts of weird tests.

In the end nothing was settled, and for some reason tonight you were going to stay here and the other you would be going home. Emily however was able to convince you that it was the best of both worlds. You hadn&#39;t got to play last night, so you would tonight.

[[The other you went home|Miki High Happiness Ending 12]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="652" name="Miki High Happiness Ending 12" tags="" position="225,8225" size="100,100">Before the other you went home the two of you had to switch outfits. The other you had gotten a new outfit from Emily&#39;s magic closet, but your parents would expect you to come home in the same thing you&#39;d worn this morning. Even if the you that came home wasn&#39;t the you that had left this morning. Plus you had to tell the other you what you&#39;d done at school today. Thinking all this was making your @@.girlVoice;head hurt@@; having two yous was complicated. At least you knew your new outfit would be @@.girlVoice;cute@@, since you&#39;d already seen how it looked on you.

This shuffle continued for the rest of the week, alternating where each of you stayed. A few other women came to Emily&#39;s house and they to asked weird questions and did weird tests. However, all of them seemed to leave looking disappointed and a bit defeated. 

On Friday night the two of you pulled a bit of a trick. Instead of switching clothes you just left everything on and you stayed at Emily&#39;s for a second night in a row. No one seemed to notice, much to your amusement.

[[The week ended|Miki High Happiness Ending 13]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="653" name="Miki High Happiness Ending 13" tags="" position="350,8225" size="100,100">Come the weekend the whole group was back together. Emily, Sophie, Kara, you and you. It seemed that Kara had something to announce to the group.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;So I was thinking about our Miki clone thingy,&quot;@@ she was excited, @@.karaVoice;&quot;I was reading a few of my comic books and I have an idea.&quot;@@ She cast a quick glance at Sophie, expecting some snarky remark about comics, but nothing came this time. @@.karaVoice;&quot;We need to ask something that only one of them could remember&quot;@@

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;We already tried that.&quot;@@

@@.karaVoice;&quot;Mmmhmm, and it didn&#39;t work because we were asking things that happened too far in the past. But there is one event that we //know// $playerName experienced, but Miki didn&#39;t.&quot;@@

She turned to the two of you, pointing at the other you,  @@.karaVoice;&quot;Potential Miki. When you first saw the other Miki, was she standing by herself, or with the rest of us?&quot;@@

Emily gasped, and even her mom looked rather impressed. It was a very clever question. Everyone had been so busy trying to solve it with weird tests and magic, that they&#39;d missed this one possible distinction.

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;She was standing by herself,&quot;@@ the other you cast a guilty glance at you, as if she was ratting you out.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;And what about you?&quot;@@

You considered the matter. If she had been standing alone that meant //you// were the original Miki, or at least thought you were. But if you&#39;d seen the other you standing with the group, it meant you weren&#39;t the real one after all. Visions of both scenes danced in your head, but which one did you feel was true?

She&#39;d thought she had a bulletproof way of figuring out which of you was which.

Emily&#39;s mommy put a hand on her shoulder, @@.momVoice;&quot;It was an excellent idea Kara. It seems the magic was rather thorough. It must have continued editing active memories until any distinction was erased.&quot;@@

Kara nodded, but she didn&#39;t look happier.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Are you saying there is no way at all to tell which is which?&quot;@@ Emily asked, and her mom responded with a nod.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Couldn&#39;t we just pick one, transform them into $playerName and then it would all be fine?&quot;@@

Emily&#39;s mom&#39;s face turned dark, @@.momVoice;&quot;That would just end in misery,&quot;@@ she took a moment, softening her look and her voice, @@.momVoice;&quot;I&#39;m sorry Sophie, that wasn&#39;t fair to you, you couldn&#39;t possibly know the implications of that suggestion.&quot;@@

Despite the softened response Sophie still looked abashed for making the suggestion.

[[Emily&#39;s mom explained|Miki High Happiness Ending 15]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="655" name="Miki High Happiness Ending 15" tags="" position="600,8225" size="100,100">@@.momVoice;&quot;Emily, let me know if I get too technical, sometimes I forget what children your age normally know.&quot;@@

@@.momVoice;&quot;They say that water takes the shape of its container, but people are a little more complicated than that. There is some essential part of them that always remembers what they were. Even if you put them into another form and seal away all their memories. There is still something that echoes who they were. The form that, if all the magic were dispelled, they would return to.&quot;@@

Sophie was clearly deeply confused, Kara was vaguely following and Emily was mostly keeping up.

@@.momVoice;&quot;To put it simply, right now both of them are Miki down to their very core. If I were to turn one of them into $playerName it wouldn&#39;t make them $playerName. It would be Miki in $playerName&#39;s body. Eventually the magic would fade, or something would dispel it and they&#39;d be right back to being Miki. Worse they would live their entire lives with an unexplainable discomfort with everything about themselves. It would be near impossible for them to ever be happy.&quot;@@

The other girls frowned. That seemed pretty clear. Even if they got it &#39;right&#39; and transformed the real $playerName, they would be miserable for the rest of their life.

Emily finally spoke up, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;So what do we do now?&quot;@@

[[There was a long pause|Miki High Happiness Ending 16]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="656" name="Miki High Happiness Ending 16" tags="" position="725,8225" size="100,100">@@.momVoice;&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;@@

That was perhaps the most terrifying thing the girls had heard since this all started. They were little kids, they assumed that adults knew basically everything, that they could solve any problem. Having that image of omniscience shattered so suddenly was jarring.

The situation did seem intractable. There were two Mikis where there should be one, and seemingly no way to separate the two or return $playerName to normal. Unless Miki&#39;s mom was willing to accept that she suddenly had identical twins there were no other straightforward options.

It was a surprise to everyone when you provided a possible answer, @@.mikiVoice;&quot;can we keep switching?&quot;@@ It&#39;d only been a week, but you actually quite liked this arrangement. Getting every other night away from your annoying brother //and// getting to spend it with Emily. Not surprisingly the other you felt the same, @@.mikiVoice;&quot;oh! Can we? Can we?&quot;@@

Initially everyone was against the idea, thinking of all the reasons it &quot;couldn&#39;t work&quot;. It would mean you only were at school half the time. What if something happened to one of you, but then the other got asked about it? Wouldn&#39;t you be angry you couldn&#39;t go out together?

But you were undeterred. The two of you understood each other better than anyone else possibly could. How hard could it be to keep each other updated with what you missed? You could even teach each other everything.

@@.momVoice;&quot;And it would be simple enough to have an illusion over one of them if they did wish to go out together...&quot;@@ Emily&#39;s mom mused.

[[Emily&#39;s mother relented|Miki High Happiness Ending 17]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="657" name="Miki High Happiness Ending 17" tags="" position="850,8225" size="100,100">So the group was left at an impasse, none of them seemed to know what else to do. Meanwhile you were just getting more and more excited. You had a //perfect// playmate, one who was just like you. You would be the best friend you could ever have.

Lacking a better solution you went forward with the swapping plan. It was intended to be a stop gap solution until something else was figured out. But as they say, there&#39;s nothing more permanent than something being temporary. So days turned into weeks, months and years.

Eventually Emily&#39;s mom revealed to you both that she had no intent to change you back. Even if a solution was discovered you were both so much older now, with years of experience and memories. No one could turn back time, and the two of you would never want them to. In the end it was a happy ending for &#39;$playerName&#39;...whichever one of you that used to be. Regarding the sleepover you were told there was something about curses and trials and souls, but it was all super complicated and you didn&#39;t really understand it. All that mattered was you were both happy with who you were.

It wasn&#39;t to say that you never had struggles, sometimes switching lives every day could be annoying, but the two of you still @@.girlVoice;loved@@ it. You&#39;d gotten a new sort of sister who you loved being around, and a new sort of mom who was able to do all sorts of fun things with magic. 

Much to her surprise it turned out you could do them as well. One day idly fiddling with Emily&#39;s wand had resulted in the other you having a pig nose, much to her horror. Emily&#39;s mom had quickly resolved the issue, but immediately undertook a training program so you&#39;d both know how to use that power.

Magic could do some &#39;&#39;amazing&#39;&#39; things, but it also came with a host of rules and restrictions neither of you wanted to deal with. The biggest boon was making it much easier for the two of you to go out together.

Until now, if you wanted to go out with the other you then Emily&#39;s mom had to cast an illusion to make one of you look like not you. Now you could cast it yourself, so you could go out whenever you wanted to. Sometimes you both cast the spell so you could go out entirely incognito, just for fun.

As the two of you aged you found more and more fun in your duplicate nature. There wasn&#39;t a soul on Earth that could tell you apart, so you could swap on a dime and no one would be the wiser. Of course you made sure to keep each other perfectly up to date with each others actions. 

Except when it was more fun not to...going on a date where the boy had no idea why you seemed to keep losing track of the conversation whenever you went to the bathroom was //way// too much fun.

There was a question about what would happen after school. Would you keep up your switching lifestyle? Would you start separate lives? Or would some other solution present itself?

You weren&#39;t worried, the two of you would figure it out, you always did. As long as you had each other everything would be fine.

If you remembered that it meant that you were actually $playerName and not the real Miki. There was a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach. Unconsciously you&#39;d known that the entire time, but you couldn&#39;t bring yourself to admit it. Every part of you insisted that you were Miki, that it was ridiculous to think anything else. It was only that one troublesome memory that was evidence to the contrary.

Emily&#39;s @@.girlVoice;mommy@@ saw the clear distress on your face and quickly moved into action. Mumbling something under her breath before you felt a familiar tingle rippling across your body. That feeling of wrongness returned, but now things were going in the opposite direction. After a few moments you were in the body of a teenage boy, it took another moment for you to come to terms with the fact that it was //your// body. A few more and you were able to accept that it was also the body you were supposed to be in.

A few moments ago you&#39;d been convinced you were Miki, and now that idea seemed ludicrous. Obviously you&#39;d looked like Miki but how could you think that you actually were her. Without Miki&#39;s memories dominating your mind it was much easier to clearly see all the signs that had shown you were never the real one.

Miki&#39;s face was a mixture of relief and disappointment. On the one had she&#39;d be able to go back to her normal life and sleep in her own bed every night. On the other hand she&#39;d lost what might have been the best playmate ever.

You understood her feelings entirely. You&#39;d miss playing with you...her. You&#39;d miss playing with Miki. But she came over often enough, you would get other chances. You&#39;d enjoy playing basically anything with her. Even silly games or a kiddie girly show. If it was with Miki it would be @@.girlVoice;fun@@.

At first you&#39;d been concerned that some of the knowledge you&#39;d lost would stay lost. However, a few classes later you were comfortably back to normal levels.

The subsequent weeks showed that there were a few other changes. You didn&#39;t notice any of it at first, but Emily and @@.girlVoice;mommy@@ certainly had, and they felt obligated to let you know.

Or at least the normal of a sixteen year old boy who&#39;s best friend was a six year old girl. It didn&#39;t bother either of you, though it wasn&#39;t something that you advertised to the world. No one involved wanted to answer all of the questions that would come along with it.

School continued on as it had before, though you&#39;d actually made a few more friends that before. Your new quirks had made you more charming to a few of the girls, though never in any romantic sense. But no matter how many friends you made you always made some time to hang out with Miki. Especially when she wasn&#39;t having a good day. You&#39;d developed some kind of sixth sense for Miki&#39;s mood, even when you hadn&#39;t seen her.

The only problem was sometimes she felt bad that she wasn&#39;t as in tune with your feelings. But that didn&#39;t bother you at all, you knew she tried and that&#39;s the best you could ever ask for. The two of you were the best of friends and nothing was going to change that, not now, not ever.

You @@.girlVoice;giggled@@ at Kara&#39;s deep consideration of the matter. She was thinking too hard. Kara was @@.girlVoice;super smart@@ but sometimes you thought it stopped her from just enjoying herself.

Grabbing her hand you gently tugged at it, pulling her towards your clone, as you did there was a strange tingling in your fingers @@.mikiVoice;&quot;come on, let&#39;s play!&quot;@@

Kara looked concerned for a moment, but then a new expression crossed her face. She smiled, showing off her missing front tooth. The three of you launched into some silly make believe games as the rest of the girls and Emily&#39;s mom continued to talk.

You&#39;d been right, this was a lot more fun with an extra person, and you&#39;d never seen Kara as at ease as she was right now. Though there was something else a little odd about her, was her hair getting darker?

You shrugged and continued your game, if Kara wanted to dye her hair that was fine, then all three of you could have the same hair color.

The play continued, though things began to become confusing. You turned to Kara to ask her a question but did a double take. The girl that looked back at you wasn&#39;t quite Kara, she actually looked quite a bit like you...in fact as you continued to watch you were sure of it. This girl looked like you with a little bit of Kara mixed in. She awkwardly grabbed at her skirt as it seemed to twist and morph.

[[You watched the girl|Mikipocalypse 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="665" name="Mikipocalypse 2" tags="" position="600,8350" size="100,100">You watched in fascination as the not Kara almost you started to look more and more like just you. Her now black hair pulled back into the same ponytails you had, complete with pink bows that appeared from nowhere. Her skin finished darkening to the same tone as yours. She hadn&#39;t shrunk much, but her clothes were doing a final shift to ensure they fit properly.

Only a few moments later you were looking into another mirror version of you who looked almost as confused as you did. The other other you turned to see the scene of two more Mikis staring back at her. Since this had already happened once before the three of you knew exactly what you needed to do...have even more fun playing together!

The trio of you got back to playing with each other. Sophie was the first one to notice what had occurred, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;Holy crap,&quot;@@ this time she couldn&#39;t suppress the mild curse, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;uh you should look at this...&quot;@@ she tugged at Emily&#39;s mom&#39;s arm, causing her and Emily to turn and look at the scene of three Mikis playing together.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Yes. It seems that way,&quot;@@ her voice was outwardly calm but there was a hint of concern underneath.

Both seemed reluctant at first, before their expression changed, the same way Kara&#39;s had. They smiled, showing off their matching missing front tooth, both of them having regained a few lost baby teeth.

Emily&#39;s mom had enough of her wits about her to back away from the scene, but that was fine with you. She was an adult, she wouldn&#39;t like playing games with you. Emily and Sophie would. Though both of them looked kinda funny. Emily&#39;s hair had dramatic black streaks and Sophie&#39;s still red hair had pulled back into pig tails with pink ribbons.

Neither of them seemed concerned with the changes, and nor were you and the other Mikis. If two of you playing together had been fun, and three was better, then surely five would be bestest.

Almost-Emily and almost-Sophie continued to play along as Emily&#39;s mom watched on in horror. The girls quickly lost height, until they stood as short as the rest of you, their clothes morphing to match. Emily&#39;s hair had gone completely black even though her skin was still a pale white. Meanwhile Sophie&#39;s freckles had grown and expanded, her skin tone matching yours, but her pigtailed hair was still red.

You all watched in fascination as the changes continued to wash over them. Moments later the five of you looked between one another.

The changes to her were almost as dramatic as the ones that had happened to $playerName, though they occurred even faster. A moment after Miki had tugged on her blouse she&#39;d shrunk down to the same size, practically drowning in her too big adult clothes. This didn&#39;t last long, in a whirl of changing and tightening fabric they transformed to suit her new stature. They also seemed to transform her to suit them.

[[There was a knock at the door|Mikipocalypse 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="668" name="Mikipocalypse 5" tags="" position="975,8350" size="100,100">You opened the door, revealing Kara&#39;s mother. @@.coachVoice;&quot;Oh, Miki, hello there. I&#39;m here to pick up Kara, is she ready to go?&quot;@@ She peered past you into the rest of the house. Clearly she hadn&#39;t expected you to answer the door and was looking for whoever was watching over the party.

But you knew better. You were a @@.girlVoice;big girl@@ you didn&#39;t need anyone to watch over you and you knew just the way to prove it. You grabbed Kara&#39;s mom&#39;s hand, pulling her back into the house to play with the rest of the girls. By the time you got back to the living room and the other Mikis you looked over to see another identical you was holding your hand.

It was a scene that played out again when Sophie&#39;s dad came to pick Sophie up but instead joined in the party. His transformation was done before he&#39;d even made it to the living room.

When your mom came to pick you up she quickly found herself buried under over half a dozen Mikis, but by the time the pile disassembled there were now nine of you. That was the first time any of you had gotten worried, it was one thing to have more playmates, but you still needed your mommy...

Scared and not knowing what to do you all made the decision to go and find your daddy. Your house wasn&#39;t far, you could walk. You weren&#39;t supposed to walk alone, but you wouldn&#39;t be alone, you had eight other yous to walk with.

[[Walk home|Mikipocalypse 6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="669" name="Mikipocalypse 6" tags="" position="1100,8350" size="100,100">By the time you finally made it home your posse had increased to a full dozen. It seemed with every new Miki the magic grew stronger, now even the lightest touch was enough to make someone into a new Miki. 

Your brother didn&#39;t even get a chance to open the door before it hit him. By the time the door swung open you were staring at another, slightly confused, Miki. The rest of the house only revealed another two Mikis and no sign of your daddy. This was enough to cause even more panic in the group.

This panic only caused the magic to spike further. Unbeknownst to any of you your neighbours houses were already filled with newly minted Mikis, and it was continuing to spread. Each new Miki wanting a new playmate &#39;just like her&#39; and propagating and feeding the mass Mikification spell.

What had taken minutes to transform one Miki under direct attention was now turning people into Mikis within seconds at a distance. Walls, floors, trees, nothing made a difference as the spell ripped through the city, leaving more distressed Mikis in it&#39;s wake.

With an entire city of Mikis boosting the spell it easily spread further. Jumping from city to city, country to country, continent to continent. It only took two hours and forty three minutes until the entire world was composed of nothing but Miki. Luckily the spell mutated enough to allow for some flexibility. Mikis in cold climes came equipped with boots, a jacket and a hat, while Mikis in potentially dangerous situations found themselves whisked away to the nearest safe spot.

With no one left to convert the magic finally came to a rest, it&#39;s mission fulfilled. Every Miki had as many perfect playmates as they could possibly want. And so the world ends, not with a bang, but with a global game of patty-cake.

Miki considered the matter. If she could give you another form for a week, what would it be? The two of you hadn&#39;t been the best of friends this party. It was clear that whatever she picked it was going to be pretty far from a sixteen year old boy. You would protest the situation, but with mom there, and on their side, there wasn&#39;t much you could do. Though having your fate in the hands of a six year old wasn&#39;t the most comforting prospect.

Finally she seemed to come to a decision. Beckoning your mother to lean down and then whispering into her ear.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Ah yes. I understand, that would be very cute.&quot;@@

Miki looked extremely excited. Her instructions had only taken a few moments. It might mean that she hadn&#39;t been able to express herself, or maybe the instructions just had been that simple. Either way you had no doubt mom would make it happen.

Your mother began to move her hands through an arcane gesture before you felt her power wash over you.

[[Weather the Changes|Miki Low Happiness Ending 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="671" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending 2" tags="" position="100,8475" size="100,100">The changes that washed over you were significant. The changes didn&#39;t bother running through the gamut of puberty, simply going straight to child. You were rapidly shrinking down, losing feet of height and dozens of pounds. The speed of the loss causing a severe case of vertigo as your perspective plummeted towards the floor. It was more luck than coordination that prevented you from simply falling over. You tottered on your short hairless legs, stepping out of your absurdly oversized socks almost by accident. Your pants and underwear had also been lost in the shuffle. But your shirt was more than up to the task of covering you. Now an oversized dress that came all the way past your knees.

You could feel a tingling on your face, a sure sign it was also changing, but without a mirror you couldn&#39;t really tell how. The long black hair that suddenly fell across your eyes was the best clue you had. You were worried that you&#39;d be left as nothing more than a toddler, but the physical regression had seemed to finally come to a halt. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &gt; 5&gt;&gt;You&#39;d never gotten this little before.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You were back to your five year old self.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; It was disorienting to go straight from sixteen to five. Your body felt so weak, it was a wonder you could move around at all with so little muscle. You supposed you were also a lot lighter to compensate. Although perhaps not at light as you would expect. You poked at your @@.girlVoice;squishy@@ and padded stomach, it seemed you were carrying a few extra pounds there. It tickled and you tried hard to suppress a @@.girlVoice;giggle@@. 

You glanced over to your mother and Miki. Miki&#39;s eyes were as wide as saucers and it was taking all of her willpower not to simply run over and hug you. Mom summoned a mirror in front of you so you could get a look at yourself. It was a little hard to see the exact shape of your body with the shapeless dress covering you. But you could feel your chubby little body underneath. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt;= 10&gt;&gt;You were a little girl again, but you looked nothing like before.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You&#39;d already noted your raven black hair, but you&#39;d neglected to notice that your skin had turned a light brown.

Your long straight black hair fell all the way to the small of your back. Your face was round and chubby, giving it a youthful innocence. Brown almond shaped eyes only pushed that image further. Your nose was actually quite big for your face but it&#39;s roundness suited the rest of you. You were @@.girlVoice;super cute@@, in an adorable kindergartener way. Looking over at Miki you realized that you were actually a couple inches shorter than her, though you probably weighed the same. But between the height and the girlishness of your face you looked noticeably younger than her, even if you were only a year apart.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Wait a second...&quot;@@ Sophie moved a little closer and narrowed her eyes, studying your form. She suddenly let out a barking laugh, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;she looks like Lilo!&quot;@@

Miki gave an embarrassed giggle, but your mother came to her rescue, @@.momVoice;&quot;she didn&#39;t ask for that specifically. But it was the image in her head, so the magic took inspiration from that.&quot;@@

You peered at yourself in the mirror again. It was hard to definitively say &#39;I look like the real life version of a cartoon character&#39;, but the resemblance was uncanny. Though if anything you thought you might be //younger// than Lilo was in the movie.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I got a new dog. His name is Stitch.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; 

Sophie lost it, cackling at your tone. Your voice was high and light. It was a touch nasally which made it sound like you had a very light lisp. The whole package made you sound even more @@.girlVoice;cute and innocent.@@ But the girliness wasn&#39;t what had made Sophie laugh. She&#39;d laughed because you sounded //exactly// like Lilo.

Your body had reached the desired final form, but your mind wasn&#39;t yet done. You knew Miki wouldn&#39;t just want you to look this young, she&#39;d want you to act that way too. 

A pressure began to build in your head. One of the few signs you knew for a dramatic mental change. The pressure built and built, it wasn&#39;t painful but it made your head feel overfull. There was too much thought in too little brain and you needed to get some of it out.

Finally there was a &#39;&#39;POP&#39;&#39;, and the pressure disappeared all at once. You reeled from the effects, your thoughts painfully making their way back to the fore. It felt like they were trudging through deep mud, and it was hard to keep a grasp on them. The keenness of the situation faded after a few moments, but you still found your thoughts coming to you distressingly slowly.

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;Let&#39;s play now!&quot;@@ Miki grabbed your hand and began to pull you away. You hadn&#39;t even noticed her walk up.

Your mother gave a cough, @@.momVoice;&quot;Maybe we should get her something to wear first?&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Huh? Yeah. Sounds good,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you answered before even looking at what Emily was offering. You were only half paying attention, you were preoccupied getting used to the new you. If you were going to be stuck like this for a week so might as well start.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Well are you going to put it on, or do we have to dress you?&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;No, no, I can dress myself...\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you finally looked at the outfit on offer. A plaid patterned shirt in pink and white, with short flared sleeves. Along with a pair of denim shorts. Each of them had the extra embellishment of watermelon slices. The shirt was covered in them and the shorts had a fake rip on each leg which showed more of the same pattern. It was very @@.girlVoice;kiddy@@...then again so were you. 

Dutifully you went and got yourself changed. A more mature you might have noted that the shorts seemed awfully short. But you were too young for you, or anyone else, to think it was anything but @@.girlVoice;cute@@.

You came back from the bathroom to model your new outfit. If nothing else it fit a lot better than a large men&#39;s shirt.

Miki and Emily agreed with your internal assessment, declaring the outfit the &#39;cutest thing they&#39;d ever seen&#39;.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;You&#39;re lucky I was here, Miki would have put you in a hula outfit or a...moo-moo?...that dress that Lilo wears.&quot;@@

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;And now the finishing touch.&quot;@@ Emily leaned over and put a pink bow into your hair. 

You thought the outfit was @@.girlVoice;totally adorable@@ but you had one concern. There was something about it that screamed you were too little to actually have picked it out yourself. The bow reinforced the childish vibe. It got to the point where it hinted that maybe you were too young to even put it on yourself. However, Emily and Miki were being so nice you let it go.

Though you trailed behind the other two. On the way up the stairs you&#39;d felt a little unstable, and the way down seemed even worse. You weren&#39;t sure if that was just a consequence of being five or if this was shaky even by those standards. Emily had offered you a helping hand, but it was too embarrassing to even consider taking it. Though it was dangerous, if your hubris meant that you tripped it&#39;d be even worse.

This time you safely tottered your way down. Into the focused gaze of the Sophie, Kara, and your mom. It seemed they were all excited to see your new outfit You were the littlest of the group, so you&#39;d be considered cute by default. They had full faith Emily and Miki would embrace and enhance that cuteness. They were not disappointed. 

Kara squealed at the sight of you, @@.karaVoice;&quot;Soooooo ccccuuuuutttteeee.&quot;@@

Sophie was impressed enough that she forgot to tease you, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;Well didn&#39;t you end up adorable?&quot;@@

Mom just smiled and sipped at her coffee.

You weren&#39;t sure how to handle this attention. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt;= 12&gt;&gt;You&#39;d gotten it from the girls at your last dress-up session, but this felt less like a game and more like a presentation.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Most of the time you would have loved a bunch of girls calling you &#39;cute&#39;, but not like this.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; 

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Yes yes, I&#39;m very cute, can I go back to normal now?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Emily shook her head, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;Nuh uh, you know the deal. You&#39;ve got to spend one whole week this way.&quot;@@

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;You gotta come to school with me.&quot;@@ Miki added.

You winced. You hadn&#39;t forgotten about that, but you&#39;d hoped you might be able to get out of it. It wasn&#39;t like you&#39;d agreed to that &#39;deal&#39; anyway. Plus, you were even //younger// than Miki, you wouldn&#39;t even be in the same class.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Do I have to?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You tried to ignore how whiny you sounded.

That didn&#39;t make you feel any better. Sure it meant less time surrounded by little kids...@@.girlVoice;kids your age@@. But it also implied you were so little you couldn&#39;t handle a whole day away from home.

Which actually led to the question, how mature were you right now? You hadn&#39;t had a chance to really contemplate your current mental state. You&#39;d only been changed for moments before Miki and Emily had dragged you away for dressup. That activity had consumed all of your mental capacity. Perhaps more than your capacity consider how often you&#39;d been distracted. It wasn&#39;t even like you were distracted by anything tangible, you&#39;d just sort of @@.girlVoice;lost focus@@. Your head felt like it was filled with @@.girlVoice;cotton candy@@. 

You suddenly noticed Miki pulling insistently on your hand, @@.mikiVoice;&quot;You don&#39;t hafta worry. Imma kindergarten helper so I&#39;ll be there too.&quot;@@

That did explain some of Miki&#39;s eagerness. Though you were surprised she was allowed to help while being so young. Maybe she was some sort of bridge between the older helpers and the really little kids...@@.girlThought;really little kids like me@@, you grimly added.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Emily can walk you to school,&quot;@@ your mom added, @@.momVoice;and we&#39;ll make sure someone is free to walk you home at lunch. Won&#39;t that be nice sweetie?@@

It was very difficult to get angry about the situation when she was being that cute. 

Plus it was only a week, surely it couldn&#39;t be that bad. You didn&#39;t have to maintain any of those relationships so you could act however you wanted and then discard the whole persona at the end of the week.

You just had to grin and bear it, then mom would turn you back and you could forget about this whole insane regression sleepover thing.

Which is what you did for the rest of the morning. You had to tolerate all of the cooing and &#39;so cute&#39;s that came from them. Even if all you&#39;d done was @@.girlVoice;clumsily drop something@@ or @@.girlVoice;trip over nothing@@. It was a little humiliating every time, but it seemed that none of the girls had any intention of teasing you for it.

You still weren&#39;t sure if you were clumsy for a five year old, or five year olds were just clumsy. You&#39;d seen Miki have similar issues, but you weren&#39;t sure she was a good comparison point. It felt like your muscles wouldn&#39;t obey you properly.

You received a fresh round of embarrassment with each parent that showed up. Your presence was brushed off as a cousin staying over for the week. An apparent delight which was met to a chorus of you being &#39;the cutest little watermelon&#39; they&#39;d ever seen. You smiled and said &#39;thank you&#39; and prayed for them all to leave.

Finally the house had been cleared of all of the visitors. Leaving just you, mom and Emily. It didn&#39;t make your current form any less annoying, but at least there were fewer people around to witness it. You took the opportunity to wander upstairs to your room, grumbling about how much focus you had to give to the &#39;simple&#39; act of climbing tall stairs.

What had you gotten yourself into? On Friday you&#39;d been a normal 16 year old boy, now you were a five year old Hawaiian girl from a Disney cartoon. You wondered if this was a normal consequence of having witches in the family, or if they were even weird by those standards. Maybe after all this was done you could start a support group for men unjustly transformed into women.

You sighed and shifted resting your head on your pillow. The moment you did a wave of sleepiness hit you, glancing over at the clock it was only 7:03PM.

Your eyes fluttered open to the sight of Emily&#39;s face inches from your own. You gave a small yelp of surprise, much to Emily&#39;s amusement.

As you tried to sit you felt woozy. Emily was too big, your bed was too big, the whole room was too big. It took you a few more moments to recall that it wasn&#39;t that everything else was huge, it was that you were @@.girlVoice;tiny@@. You were practically drowning in blankets. You&#39;d fallen asleep on top of the blankets so someone, likely mom, had tucked you in while you slept. 

She&#39;d also placed a @@.girlVoice;cute cloth dolly@@ beside you. It seemed too childish, but there was something compelling. You reached out to it, holding it close to you. The @@.girlVoice;relief@@ was immediate, and you cuddled it closer to strengthen the feeling. Childish or not, it was helping, so you wouldn&#39;t let it go for now.

You were still wearing your @@.girlVoice;cute little watermelon outfit@@, but it&#39;d gotten wrinkly overnight. Emily had you covered. There was a whole outfit laid out at the end of your bed. It was different that your current getup, but it still drove home a certain theme. 

A white long sleeve with a pink @@.girlVoice;Hello Kitty@@ silhouette with a bow. This was the more restrained of the two piece outfit. The skirt was naturally a bright pink and the rest of it was...a lot. You weren&#39;t sure the right term for it but it had three layers and all of them were lacy and fluffy. In case that wasn&#39;t enough there was a little pink ribbon just to confirm the girl wearing this was as @@.girlVoice;girly@@ as humanly possible. You had zero doubt this was Emily&#39;s choice. If she was getting the chance to dress up her &#39;big brother&#39; as a kindergarten girl, she was going to take full advantage of it.

Inwardly you grumbled, but there wasn&#39;t much you could do. You did have to go to school today, and it wasn&#39;t like anything you owned would work. It was Emily&#39;s new choice, or what you already wore. You current outfit was both crumpled, and equally childish, so you were stuck. Plus mom would probably insist you look good for your &#39;first day&#39;. Glumly you got yourself dressed, once again denying Emily&#39;s offers to assist and headed downstairs.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Now you be good. I&#39;ll come take you home at lunch, okay?&quot;@@

You nodded in response, still overwhelmed at the situation. You didn&#39;t trust your voice right now, it might betray how @@.girlVoice;scared@@ you were. There was a part of you that just wanted Emily to stay, and you subtly @@.girlVoice;squeezed her hand@@ as she pulled it away.

With that she was gone and it was time for class. You looked around for Miki, but it seemed she wasn&#39;t here yet. You&#39;d never admit it, you&#39;d @@.girlVoice;feel much better if she were around@@.

As much as you could consider the letters of the alphabet or the numbers from one to ten to be educational. You didn&#39;t exactly need the days of the week listed on the wall for you to remember them. //Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...Tues//...you glanced at the wall, //Thursday, Friday...// another glance, //Saturday, Sunday//. See? Easy.

You expected the rest of class to be that simple. You were wrong. Since it was only a half day you only had so much time for actual learning. In older grades this would have meant time for only one or two subjects, but here you were still going to push through four separate things. The teacher had called it &#39;circle rotation&#39;, which you didn&#39;t properly understand, but figured you&#39;d be able to just follow the other kids.

Mercifully the other children seemed more than happy to include you in their group. A few of them were a bit shy about the newcomer, but the more brash among them were quick to start dragging you along. Since this was your first day you weren&#39;t expected to actually do any work, and were welcome just to follow along.

Initially you weren&#39;t concerned about that. It was kindergarten, it wasn&#39;t like you would need a day to ramp up to the &#39;complex&#39; lessons they had. Plus each lesson was no more than 20 minutes. Presumably the teacher didn&#39;t believe that the kids could focus for any longer than that. 

However, you were only an hour in and that confidence was beginning to erode. The initial concerns had crept in during the reading circle. You&#39;d been &quot;reading&quot; along with another student, but if she stopped saying the words out loud, you lost track of things. Alone you weren&#39;t sure you could read it at all. But the issue crystallized when you got to the math circle.

The group worked together trying to solve each question, with the teacher keeping an eye out for struggles. 

@@.playerVoice2;&quot;What is six minus three?&quot;@@ Your neighbour Ashton read out the next question. From the silence that followed it was clear that no one was confident, even if they thought they knew the answer.

@@.playerVoice3;&quot;It&#39;s nine?&quot;@@ Kevin offered cautiously. You didn&#39;t feel the need to speak up, no point messing with the learning process for the rest of them. Anyways, Kevin @@.girlVoice;had it right@@, it was just for the rest of the group to understand why.

@@.playerVoice5;&quot;Nuh uh. That&#39;s adding,&quot;@@ Ashley corrected and your heart fell, realizing the truth of her words. How had you got that wrong? You&#39;d done addition and not subtraction. A @@.girlVoice;mistake@@ on something that should be trivial.

@@.playerVoice5;&quot;I think it&#39;s uh...three?&quot;@@

The teacher had slid in behind you at this point and nodded her assent, bringing a smile to Ashley&#39;s face. The rest of the group nodded their agreement, even if they still didn&#39;t understand. You wouldn&#39;t admit it to yourself, but you were part of that unenlightened group.

At least after that it was time for a break. All of you were ushered out onto the playground for a short recess. Even for you it was a welcome change. Everything had been a bit @@.girlVoice;overwhelming@@, so just enjoying some simple sun would be nice.

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;&lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;! How are you?&quot;@@ Miki suddenly chirped from behind you. Turns out that this is where she helped out, being an extra set of eyes at recess.

[[You turned to Miki|Miki Low Happiness Ending 16]]

You weren&#39;t exactly having a good time, but this was supposed to be a week of you learning a lesson. If you whined and complained all week then mom might think you hadn&#39;t learnt anything. Who knew what the consequences of that would be? Another sleepover? Another week in kindergarten? You really didn&#39;t want to find out.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I&#39;m okay. Itsa lot to get used to,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; hopefully a middle of the road answer would satisfy, but Miki looked concerned.

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m here for you.&quot;@@ she suddenly engulfed you in a hug. You were struck by a sudden whirlwind of emotions. It was a strange reminder of how small you&#39;d become and it felt like an unnecessary comfort meant for a child. On the other hand it did make you @@.girlVoice;feel a lot better@@. You hadn&#39;t realized how tense you&#39;d gotten. The day was pretty @@.girlVoice;overwhelming@@ and having a point of stability, even if it was just Miki, was nice.

She finally broke the hug, smiling at you, a @@.girlVoice;small grin@@ sneaking onto your own face. Miki took ahold of your hand and lead you over to the rest of the group. A game of tag had broken out which, at Miki&#39;s urging, you reluctantly joined. And since Miki was the oldest one they decreed that she should be &#39;it&#39; for the first round.

[[Play tag|Miki Low Happiness Ending 17]]

It quickly turned out that you had @@.girlVoice;no such ability@@. It would be trivial for Miki to catch you if she wanted, but she being nice and avoided targeting you. 

In traditional elementary school fashion whoever got caught would become &#39;it&#39;.  It was a tremendously unfair situation really. The first one caught would usually be one of the slowest. Which meant it was going to be difficult for them to catch anyone else. 

Which turned out to be the case. Suzy had been Miki&#39;s first catch and now she was struggling to tag anyone else. Once again it seemed that she was avoiding going after you. Likely it was because it would be mean to target the &#39;new girl&#39;. Suzy was a nice girl, but after a number of failures it was clear that she didn&#39;t want to be &#39;it&#39; anymore. 

Her chase of you was brief. You&#39;d had a head start, but had @@.girlVoice;stumbled@@ over a &#39;bumpy patch&#39; of grass. Your @@.girlVoice;clumsiness@@ meant she was able to easily tag you. 

Which meant it was now your turn to hunt down your new classmates. It went @@.girlVoice;poorly@@, @@.girlVoice;very poorly@@. It seemed like every one of them was @@.girlVoice;faster than you@@. Eventually you managed to get enough of a jump on a daydreaming Zack that you&#39;d be able to get him.

The fall hadn&#39;t hurt much, but you still felt @@.girlVoice;tears@@ stinging at the corner of your eyes. It was so frustrating not being able to catch a bunch of kids. Even if you were the same size as them, you&#39;d thought you&#39;d be able to get at least one. Miki came to your rescue. 

She came over to check on you. @@.mikiVoice;&quot;You okay?&quot;@@

You did your best to hold back tears, but were already @@.girlVoice;sniffling@@, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I&#39;m fine.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You weren&#39;t about to start whining and crying over such a minor fall. Assured that you were okay she &#39;accidentally&#39; let herself get tagged. Though she helped you back up before she ran off. You were of course safe from Miki as there were no tag backs.

Everyone made the comment that @@.girlVoice;kids your age@@ had boundless energy. You didn&#39;t feel that way at all. It seemed that in terms of raw endurance you were on the @@.girlVoice;lower end of the scale@@, the extra weight on your stomach probably didn&#39;t help.

After a few more moments you were back up and most ready to go...just in time for the bell to go off and be forced back into class. The second half of the morning was no better for you. Art had never been your strong suit and trying it with a fraction of your normal coordination seemed like a recipe for disaster, so you contented yourself with just watching.

A trend you continued into the writing circle. You&#39;d been all ready to write something that would blow everyone else away, but a few words in you realized it wasn&#39;t going to happen.

Mercifully the rest of the day was passive enough. Being read a story, a little playing around and then it was time to pack up. Emily was already waiting for you when you exited.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;How&#39;d it go?&quot;@@ She questioned, after the two of you had gotten some distance from the school.

You mumbled something vague about it being @@.girlVoice;overwhelming@@ and she was gracious enough to accept it. On your part you just wanted to get home as quickly as possible and forget all about the day. Until it came you were going to do your best to ignore that tomorrow even existed.

Mom of course had more questions at dinner, but you were able to give enough non-committal to satisfy her for the moment. The evening was depressingly short, since you were @@.girlVoice;out cold by 7:30@@. At least tonight you&#39;d been concious enough to get yourself under the blankets, even if mom had insisted on tucking you in.

...

Seemingly only moments later you were looking up at Emily&#39;s smiling face. @@.emilyVoice;&quot;Wakey wakey. Time for school.&quot;@@

You groaned but acquiesced, following the same routine you had the day before. Getting put in overly cutesy clothes, mom making you a snack, Emily urging you to hurry up. It was still somewhat discombobulating but you were aware enough to notice the subtle change in your shoes. 

There were still laces on the bottom half of the shoe, but they were mostly decorative. What actually held it in place was a simple velcro strip. Simple enough that you managed to do it on your own. But how to feel about it? Proud that you got your shoes on @@.girlVoice;all by yourself@@? Or mortified that velcro was the best you could do? Tough decision.

First was art, and this time you couldn&#39;t just sit and watch. The task was simple enough, draw three flowers. It was left to your creativity about the kind of flower and they were allowed to all be the same. Most it seemed were going with the classic, vaguely daisy looking flower, though even some of those were already devolving into just being colored circles.

You had twenty minutes to complete the task. What did you want to draw first?

Yesterday you&#39;d mostly managed to just glide along under the radar, but today you were going to have to actually pick something to serious read. There was a staggering number options, but they had been separated into three categories.

&#39;Cool&#39;: Which had a series of picture books.
&#39;Warm&#39;: Which had books with fewer pictures and more words.
&#39;Hot&#39;: Which had long books with only a couple pictures.

The other students had already picked their books. Most of them had taken something from the &#39;Cool&#39; or &#39;Warm&#39; pile, but a couple had grabbed something from &#39;Hot&#39;. Your memory wasn&#39;t perfect but you were pretty sure all the &#39;Hot&#39; students had the same books yesterday. Maybe that made sense. The books were too long to be read in twenty minutes, so they had to take multiple days.

But what did you want to read?
[[&#39;Cool&#39;: The Dot|Miki Low Happiness Ending 27a]]
[[&#39;Warm&#39;: Good Night, Good Knight|Miki Low Happiness Ending 27b]]
[[&#39;Hot&#39;: Dora Fantasmagory|Miki Low Happiness Ending 27c]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="697" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending 27a" tags="" position="850,8725" size="100,100">You let your concerns get the better of you and picked the simplest thing that you could find. Lots of other kids were taking books just like it, so it wasn&#39;t like you were going to stand out.

You settled in a nearby beanbag chair and got to reading. Well perhaps &quot;reading&quot; was a generous way to refer to it, 90% of each page was taken up by the pictures. They were very @@.girlVoice;pretty pictures@@. As you continued you found it was easier to @@.girlVoice;follow the pictures@@ than the accompanying text. The text was @@.girlVoice;boring@@ and @@.girlVoice;complicated@@. The book was all about art anyway, so shouldn&#39;t you just look at pictures?

It turned out that you were taking a little too long staring at the pictures, because the teacher said that reading time was over and you had to move on. You were disappointed, you&#39;d wanted to finish that book. It was thirty pages and you&#39;d made it over half way! Maybe you could continue tomorrow? Assuming you came back again.

[[The last lesson|Miki Low Happiness Ending 28]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="698" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending 27b" tags="" position="975,8725" size="100,100">You decided to follow the smaller, but still significant group, taking what appeared to be the middle option. You still had some amount of pride, you weren&#39;t some baby who could only read picture books.

Though once you really dove into the book you had revise your opinion. This book was still about 50% pictures, but still there was a lot more text than anything would have in the &#39;Cool&#39; section.

On the cover were three @@.girlVoice;cute@@ little dragons in pyjamas and a man in metal with a horse peering at them. You had @@.girlVoice;little idea@@ what it could be about. It was called &#39;Good Night, Good Knight&#39;. Knight. The word was unfamiliar. You tried to sound it out.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;K-nai-t\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You knew the word &quot;night&quot; so you&#39;d just said it with a &#39;k&#39; in front. It hadn&#39;t helped, you still didn&#39;t know the word.  How could you not know a word this small? You should know @@.girlVoice;big kid@@ words.

@@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;Very good!&quot;@@ The teacher called out from behind you. //How is she always there?// 
@@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;That is exactly how it looks like it should sound.&quot;@@

@@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;Knight is a very hard word because the &#39;K&#39; is silent.&quot;@@

@@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot;@@ she made it sound like you&#39;d uncovered some great secret, @@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;you don&#39;t say the &#39;K&#39; at all. And if you don&#39;t have to say the &#39;K&#39; what would it sound like?&quot;@@

You looked back to the word, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;K--\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; no that was silent, you had to skip it...which meant...&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;nai-t...night!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; 

@@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;Very good!&quot;@@ The teacher clapped her hands, @@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;now do you know who the knight is?&quot;@@ She pointed at the word &quot;knight&quot; to ensure you knew what she was referring to.

This was easy, you hoped. You knew the dragons were dragons, and the horse was a horse, and the trees were trees. Hesitantly you pointed at the man in armor, the knight(?).

@@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;You&#39;re doing so well!&quot;@@ She once again cheered.

Emboldened you took one last look at the title, understanding dawning on you. &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;It&#39;s good nai-t, good nai-t!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You shouted, the teacher pausing at your exultation, but not saying anything. &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Good nai-t,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you pointed to the dark night sky. &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Good nai-t,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you pointed to the knight. You carefully enunciated each word, to make sure she understood. Even though the words sounded the same, they actually meant //different// things.

@@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;It is,&quot;@@ the teacher spoke gravely. To you it confirmed that you&#39;d realized something and only your explanation had made her realize it. @@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;Oh that&#39;s wonderful,&quot;@@ she continued, @@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;those are very hard words to understand.&quot;@@ 

Your grin just kept getting wider.
@@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;I see you&#39;re working very hard with your book, I&#39;m very impressed.&quot;@@ 
You puffed your chest out. 
@@.mikiMomVoice;&quot;you&#39;ll have to show me any other hard words, okay?&quot;@@

You nodded eagerly, looking back to your book for more great mysteries you could solve.

[[You continued to read|Miki Low Happiness Ending 27b 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="700" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending 27b 3" tags="" position="1225,8725" size="100,100">Things went downhill from there. The title was only three different words, and the teacher had helped you with one of them. The rest of the book had //a lot// of words, a ton of which you didn&#39;t recognize. The pictures helped you enough that you could mostly get the gist of what was happening, but the details eluded you. &#39;Dense&#39;, &#39;kingdom&#39;, &#39;faraway&#39;, what did these words mean? You could understand &quot;far away&quot;, but what was &quot;faraway&quot;? To make your life easier you starting skipping @@.girlVoice;hard words@@ entirely. 

Furthermore you&#39;d realized how silly your earlier success was. You&#39;d managed to pronounce one word correctly, after assistance. The teacher had known the whole time. She was just patronizing you. Maybe an actual five year old would consider it real praise, but to you it was galling. Frustrated you tried to continue pushing through the book, each new unfamiliar word slowing you down, and sapping your enthusiasm to continue.

You glanced over at the &#39;Cool&#39; table, regretting your choice, those books looked a lot shorter. The one was &#39;&#39;fifty&#39;&#39; pages, even if you just looked at pictures that felt @@.girlVoice;near impossible@@. You let your eyes drift to see what everyone else was reading.

This actually went on for several minutes before the teacher called for the end of the activity. Looking down you realized how little progress you&#39;d made. You could see that more pages were on the &quot;unread&quot; side of the book than the &quot;read&quot; side. Which meant...You changed tact, page...eighteen. And there were fifty pages so...  

You abandoned the @@.girlVoice;frustrating@@ math and @@.girlVoice;even more frustrating@@ book. You hadn&#39;t been able to keep attention on a book even for twenty minutes and you&#39;d @@.girlVoice;lost focus@@. You&#39;d read books that were //hundreds// of pages before.

Books were supposed to have lots of words and you were going to read a proper one. You didn&#39;t actually know what a &#39;Fantasmagory&#39; was, you didn&#39;t even know how to say the word, but it sounded interesting so you picked it up.

This turned out to be a disaster. There were just @@.girlVoice;so many words@@ and you kept coming across ones you didn&#39;t know. At first the pictures were enough to keep you on track. The main character was a little girl named Dora. She was six and if you&#39;d read the first chapter title right, &quot;Such a Baby&quot;, then all those word bubbles were probably making fun of her for being a baby. 

This was difficult enough to follow, but after some deep thought you realized that five was less than six, so you were @@.girlVoice;even younger@@ than her. If Dora was a baby, what were you?

The bigger problem was what happened next, which is to say a confusing jumble of things. You&#39;d underestimated the number of words this book had and the amount of characters it expected you to follow. Part way through the first chapter there were Dora, and her two siblings and a @@.girlVoice;scary monster@@. It kept having the word &quot;Mary&quot; with pictures of the monster so you figured that must be the monsters name.

@@.girlThought;That&#39;s a weird name for a monster...maybe Mary is actually the sister?@@

You&#39;d made it all the way to page twelve, fooling yourself into thinking you understood things. But then things reached a breaking point. Theyy started adding even more monsters, each one with a different name and sometimes the pictures weren&#39;t any help. Some of them made sense, the &quot;Toilet Monster&quot; had a picture of a toilet beside it. But what was a &quot;Ketchup Monster&quot;? What was a &quot;Living Room&quot;? You knew each of the words individually, but the picture showed the monster on a couch...was a &quot;living room&quot; a fancy word for couch? How was any of this supposed to help you understand the @@.girlVoice;complicated words@@?

Eventually you simply closed the book with a frustrated huff. You didn&#39;t want to @@.girlVoice;read dumb books@@ for kids anyway, you had better things to do. Though all you had at the moment was to wait the @@.girlVoice;eternity@@ until the end of the activity. When it finally came you were eager to move on and get this day over with.

Just like yesterday it was a &#39;simple&#39; writing task. You just had to write what you were going to do on the weekend and draw an accompanying picture. This proved to be nearly impossible. To start with you were in a somewhat complicated situation. It made it @@.girlVoice;difficult to comprehend@@ what exactly the weekend would bring. Even when you tried to default to something simple, &#39;I am going to the shopping mall.&#39; It didn&#39;t work. You stared down at your attempt:

&lt;section class=&quot;paper paper--postActivity&quot;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;papertext&quot;&gt;\
&lt;span class=&quot;journal7&quot;&gt;iM a. &lt;span style=&quot;letter-spacing: -4px;&quot;&gt;soqaLL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Even knowing what you were trying to write you @@.girlVoice;couldn&#39;t understand what you were supposed to do@@. You couldn&#39;t get the words out of your head onto the page, you just @@.girlVoice;didn&#39;t understand how writing worked@@. So you&#39;d ended up with this random jumble of letters.

Looking around you were hardly the only one struggling, a few classmates hadn&#39;t even tried to write anything, just focusing on their picture. On the other hand you read one which said &#39;I am garben with mommy I like garben Flower is prety&#39;. It was still somewhat broken, but you were actually able to almost understand it. You hadn&#39;t even come close to that. No one would be able to make heads or tails of your uneven chicken scratch.

Having all these kiddie activities thrown at you, ones you should be able to cruise through without even a thought. Instead you were failing at them! Repeatedly! It seemed like over half the class had been better than you at everything you&#39;d tried. You wouldn&#39;t say you were the dumbest kid in the room, but you&#39;d be in the running.

@@.girlThought;It&#39;s not fair!@@ 

Why had Miki wanted you like this? Why had mom turned you into this? Why was everybody being so mean to you? You&#39;d only misbehaved a little at a @@.girlVoice;stupid@@ sleepover for little girls. You didn&#39;t deserve any of this!

This time you weren&#39;t able to @@.girlVoice;hold back the tears@@, and that was just the start of it. @@.girlVoice;Tears@@ beget @@.girlVoice;sniffling@@ and once you were @@.girlVoice;crying and snotty@@ you felt even more humiliated about the situation. Here you were a @@.girlVoice;five year old girl@@, not able to handle even a @@.girlVoice;half day@@ of kindergarten. 

The thought made you @@.girlVoice;feel even worse@@ and you started @@.girlVoice;wailing@@. What ensued was either a @@.girlVoice;temper tantrum@@ or a @@.girlVoice;meltdown@@ depending on your perspective. Regardless the teacher hadn&#39;t been able to @@.girlVoice;calm you down@@, even when she&#39;d taken you out of the classroom.

In the end they&#39;d called your mom to come and pick you up a little early. The teacher explained the whole situation when she arrived. She apologized to them for your behaviour, but the teacher shook her head. After that the two of them launched into a somewhat heated conversation. You weren&#39;t close enough to be privy to the words themselves, but from the tone your teacher was concerned about something. When it was over you mom had a strange look on her face. She didn&#39;t look angry, it wasn&#39;t even disappointment. Your best guess was that now mom shared whatever concern the teacher had.

[[Go home|Miki Low Happiness Ending 29]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="704" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending 29" tags="" position="475,8850" size="100,100">You didn&#39;t speak the whole way home. Your mom made a few attempts to get you to open up but you rebuffed her. Once you got home you marched up into your room and @@.girlVoice;slammed the door@@. Or at least @@.girlVoice;as much as a five year old could@@ slam a heavy wooden door. @@.girlVoice;Collapsing onto your bed@@ you felt the @@.girlVoice;tears returning@@. But you&#39;d lost the fiery anger you&#39;d had before. There was no yelling and wailing this time, you were simply there on your bed @@.girlVoice;sobbing and sniffling@@.

When there was a knock on the door you reflexively told them to &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Go away!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Without even giving them a chance to speak. You even tossed your stuffed doll at the door to drive home your point. Though you regretted that decision immediately, it&#39;d been the @@.girlVoice;only thing comforting you@@. This only made you feel worse, because you realized you&#39;d become reliant on @@.girlVoice;having your dolly@@.

But your door didn&#39;t have a lock, so it swung open. Your mom stood in the doorway, Emily and Miki trailing behind her, the girls looked like they&#39;d been crying a little too. Miki didn&#39;t even give your mom a chance to speak before she was running across the room. You&#39;d sat up to look at them only to find yourself tackled back onto the bed in a hug.

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot;@@ Miki was crying, @@.mikiVoice;&quot;I didn&#39;t...want...to make...you sad.&quot;@@ Her words were interspersed with sniffles and hitched breaths.

Mom explained, @@.momVoice;&quot;your teacher explained the situation and I also have to apologize. I hadn&#39;t considered how frustrating the situation could potentially be.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;It&#39;s not fair! I&#39;m dumb and slow and weak and stupid...\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

@@.girlThought;Good. She should feel bad.@@ The bitter thought tempted you, but you fought to keep control.

Mom continued, @@.momVoice;&quot;which is exactly the way that Miki felt.&quot;@@

The words hit hard. Casting a glance at Emily you could see that she was crying as well. The whole situation crystallized in your mind. Miki was the youngest in the group. At that age every year brought dramatic changes. Miki was less mature, both mentally and physically. The girls would have a natural edge on her physically, and the one girl who should be close to her mentally, Kara, was ridiculously gifted. Merely being around an @@.girlVoice;athlete@@ like Sophie, a @@.girlVoice;genius@@ like Kara and a literal witch like Emily was bound to make her feel inadequate.

You tried to keep your voice gentle despite your emotional turmoil, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;and she wanted me to feel that way instead.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;No! I just didn&#39;t wanna feel dumb...&quot;@@

At this point Emily crossed the floor throwing both of you into a hug. @@.emilyVoice;&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Miki. I didn&#39;t know.&quot;@@

There was a catharsis in that moment. No one had any malice to anyone else, no one was //trying// to be cruel. Insensitivity from all sides had caused unnecessary and unintended pain. You couldn&#39;t even hold yourself innocent on that point, not after the sleepover. It wasn&#39;t that Miki wanted you to get frustrated or be made fun of...okay maybe a little...but mostly she just wanted the burden shifted off of her.

[[Mom coughed|Miki Low Happiness Ending 31]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="706" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending 31" tags="" position="725,8850" size="100,100">@@.momVoice;&quot;I have a solution,&quot;@@ all three of you looked at her, @@.momVoice;&quot;I think &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; should finish out the week in this form.

She moved over to the bed and held your hand, @@.momVoice;&quot;Your teacher tells me that you&#39;re doing perfectly fine for someone your age. But you can&#39;t see that, because you&#39;re comparing yourself to someone a decade older. With this you&#39;ll be able to spend the week still learning about Miki and Emily&#39;s world, but without all that baggage. Does that seem fair?&quot;@@

It didn&#39;t seem fair, you just wanted to go back to normal. But looking at Emily and Miki&#39;s red faces and puffy eyes it felt like a betrayal to not finish the week. If you didn&#39;t have to remember being older it should make everything more tolerable. It wasn&#39;t like the activities had been entirely unpleasant, you&#39;d just been constantly burdened by the knowledge of how far you&#39;d &#39;fallen&#39;.

So you nodded, still @@.girlVoice;sniffling@@. Mom unstoppered the vial and held it up beside your face. Before you could ask what she was doing one of the remaining tears fell out of your eye and into the vial. There was a moment of blackness and you felt something tugging at your mind, but then it was over. Mom was stoppering the vial full of an unknown clear sparkly liquid and squirreling it away back into it&#39;s secret pocket.

@@.momVoice;&quot;How are you feeling?&quot;@@

[[Everyone waited on your answer|Miki Low Happiness Ending 32]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="707" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending 32" tags="" position="850,8850" size="100,100">How were you feeling? It was an excellent question. It took you a few moments to terms with the sudden shift in your memories. You knew consciously that mom had taken a huge chunk, but you couldn&#39;t actually feel the loss. You couldn&#39;t remember the things you didn&#39;t remember, so to you, you couldn&#39;t remember losing anything.

The change retroactively made your recent behaviour very odd. It wasn&#39;t surprising that you&#39;d been on edge, it was an entirely new school, new teacher, new classmates. But everyone had been so friendly, and the teacher was so nice, and the activities were kinda fun...

It was your poor performance that had bothered you. But now it didn&#39;t seem like anything worth having a meltdown about. You hadn&#39;t been doing great, but there were other students at about your level, lots in fact. You didn&#39;t need to be the smartest girl in the room to be happy. As long as you weren&#39;t //too// far behind you could still having fun.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I feel...better,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you finally offered. This brought a smile to the faces of the two girls still half attached to you. Their pleasure resulting in a renewed hugging session from the group. 

What transpired from there was a much more collaborative plan for the next few days. How to make sure that you had the support you would need. It wasn&#39;t like you were going to have the time to learn anything, but Emily and mom would help get you through the lessons a bit smoother. Miki would also keep a better eye on you during recess to make sure that you weren&#39;t struggling unnecessarily. 

On the other side Emily swore that she&#39;d make sure Miki never ever ever felt inferior again. She&#39;d relay this entire story to Sophie and Kara, to make sure that they were all more sensitive to Miki&#39;s feelings. Mom assured you that if the issue was other students, she&#39;d be sure to talk to Miki&#39;s mom, and the school if required. And if that didn&#39;t solve anything, then a few hours spent as a toad was a very effective method of correcting the behaviour of wayward children. From the smile she gave you weren&#39;t entirely sure if she was kidding or not.

When you fell asleep that night, your @@.girlVoice;dolly clutched to your chest@@, at the @@.girlVoice;incredibly late@@ hour of 8pm, you were actually @@.girlVoice;a little excited@@ for what tomorrow might bring.

[[The next day|Miki Low Happiness Ending 33]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="708" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending 33" tags="" position="975,8850" size="100,100">You were right to have been excited. When you woke you practically jumped out of bed, well before Emily came to wake up. You even gave your own input on your outfit for the morning. The newest outfit went great with your @@.girlVoice;cute little Hello Kitty sneakers@@. Sneakers which you were able to put on @@.girlVoice;all by yourself@@. Mommy said that was very impressed and said that one day you&#39;d even be able to have full laces. You smiled and thanked her, @@.girlVoice;taking Emily&#39;s hand@@ as she walked you to school.

The teacher was keeping an eye on you as the day started out, being even more gentle with you than usual. She wanted to ensure that you felt as comfortable as possible. But you didn&#39;t really have any worries today, you&#39;d @@.girlVoice;brought your dolly@@ in case you got stressed.

Though the lessons themselves didn&#39;t go any better than before. @@.girlVoice;Reading was hard@@, though you did @@.girlVoice;enjoy your picture book@@. @@.girlVoice;Writing was worse@@, but you still got to @@.girlVoice;draw a pretty picture@@. The post recess lessons went much the same. @@.girlVoice;Math was super hard@@, but everyone made mistakes so you were all there to help each other. You also got to learn lots about the different parts of the body, even if you&#39;d @@.girlVoice;forgotten most of the words already@@. You could just @@.girlVoice;go with the flow@@.

All in all you&#39;d actually enjoyed yourself in circles, and those lessons had been the worst part of the day. The teacher had read you an @@.girlVoice;amazing story@@, you all got to have fun @@.girlVoice;singing and dancing@@ and at recess you got to draw with chalk and @@.girlVoice;play hopscotch@@. You kept making mistakes with the counting, but it was still @@.girlVoice;lots of fun@@. By the time Emily came to pick you up you didn&#39;t want to go. She promised you that you&#39;d get to come back and see all your friends tomorrow, so you relented and walked home without any further fuss.

It was actually a little surprising how much variance there was to everything. What you hadn&#39;t noticed is that they were actually all teaching the same lesson. Counting with apples was actually the same as counting with marbles was actually the same as counting with cartoon dolphins. But to you it felt like something entirely new each time, not noticing that your counting was improving day by day.

Walking home on Friday you were @@.girlVoice;gushing@@ to Emily about all the things that you were going to do next week. It was only at dinner that mom reminded you that next week wouldn&#39;t be the same.

@@.momVoice;&quot;When you&#39;re ready just take it to your room. If you drink it it&#39;ll give you back your memories and turn you back into a sixteen year old boy.&quot;@@

You nodded again, fiddling with the vial all through dinner. Your preoccupation meant your food had gotten cold, having barely been touched. Not wanting cold peas, you excused yourself.

[[Up to your room|Miki Low Happiness Ending 35]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="710" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending 35" tags="" position="1225,8850" size="100,100">You sat down on your @@.girlVoice;too tall@@ bed, @@.girlVoice;smoothing out your skirt@@ once you&#39;d settled. You held the vial in front of you, peering closely at it. The liquid was @@.girlVoice;very very pretty@@ and @@.girlVoice;sparkly@@, but that wasn&#39;t the important part. You knew it was supposed to contain your old memories, but you didn&#39;t actually know what those were. You&#39;d got some hints of your old life from mom and Emily, but otherwise it was almost entirely a mystery.

Popping the cork you sniffed at the liquid. The scent was entirely unfamiliar. You decided that it was an entirely unique &#39;memory smell&#39;. In truth it&#39;s scent was close to Rosemary, but at five you hadn&#39;t smelled Rosemary, at least not that you remembered.

Delaying your change, you swirled it around, watching the way that it sparkled as it caught the light. A specific glint triggered something in your mind. Mom said that if you drank it, then you&#39;d go back to the old you. But the only memories you had of the &#39;old you&#39; was from the first two days of this week, and that person had been miserable. 

What kind of life could it have been if you&#39;d been willing to give up all those memories? You&#39;d never let anyone take your memories of the last three days. And that was only a handful of days. Was this vial full of years and years of misery.

[[Consider your options|Miki Low Happiness Ending 36]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="711" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending 36" tags="" position="100,8975" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;set $playerMaturity to 16&gt;&gt;\
As you continued to swirl the vial you dimly realized that your mind seemed to be sharper. Mom would have made sure you had all of your faculties before making a decision like this.

//Decision? Was this supposed to be a decision?//

The obvious thing was to drink it and turn back, mommy had said you should...no...she hadn&#39;t. She&#39;d said &#39;&#39;if&#39;&#39; you drank it you&#39;d go back. Did that mean you didn&#39;t have to?

As you considered the first half of the week. All the misery. Embarrassment at every mistake, berating yourself even long after the situation had passed. It had been an extreme example but you felt your &#39;old life&#39; wasn&#39;t much different. Endlessly worrying you&#39;d do something wrong, or say something stupid, a constant weight on your mind.

The back half of the week, in contrast, had been a joy. You&#39;d made endless math mistakes, tripped over your own feet, and couldn&#39;t write anything...and you just @@.girlVoice;giggled@@ your way through it. Little embarrassments passed through your mind with nary a trace, accepting them and then moving onto the next thing. Why linger on an error when you could try again, maybe you&#39;d do it right that time. Every success was a @@.girlVoice;joy@@, even if it was just successfully counting a handful of butterflies. 

You tilted the vial, the liquid coming to the edge of the lip, threatening to spill out. If you tilted a little further all those miserable memories would be gone for good, the old you would be gone. You&#39;d get to live this life forever. Is that what you wanted?

You weren&#39;t about to throw out the entirety of your old life, even if you didn&#39;t totally remember it right now. So you tipped the vial back and swallowed down the surprisingly sweet liquid. It took only a moment for the effects to kick in, your stomach twisted and you doubled over. It wasn&#39;t terribly painful, but it was deeply uncomfortable. You had no idea why but shrinking had been much more pleasant than growing was now.

In a rare moment of foresight you hurriedly removed your outfit before the transformation continued. Clothes didn&#39;t seem to usually change with the transformation and you didn&#39;t want to tear one of Emily&#39;s outfits apart. Likely this was why mom had suggested doing the transformation in your room, but you hadn&#39;t taken the hint. The rest of the transformation wasn&#39;t worth dwelling upon, you knew what you were turning into. So it was just the straightforward change from A to B with no surprises. Mostly it was just everything about you getting bigger and hairier.

Quickly enough you were back to your normal self, or at least close enough that you couldn&#39;t tell the difference. With your memories restored this form felt as natural as your &#39;Lilo&#39; form had a few moments ago. 

You grabbed a outfit from your closet, glad to be back into simple guy clothes. Though even you had to chuckle at how limited your options were in comparison to a girl.

[[Back downstairs|Miki Low Happiness Ending Drink 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="713" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending Drink 2" tags="" position="350,8975" size="100,100">Mom and Emily didn&#39;t look surprised when you came down the stairs in your normal form, though there was an air of disappointment.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Everything back to normal &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;?&quot;@@ Mom asked mildly.

You inclined your head in thanks and breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed that your hands on experiences with girlhood were over and you could go back to normal life.

On their part they tried to be a lot more patient with Miki. Acknowledging the fact that she was younger, but working hard to not make it exclusionary. 

Emily made sure that Miki&#39;s voice was heard more often and that she could make some of the group&#39;s decisions. 

Sophie cut back on some of her more cutting jibes. When Miki wasn&#39;t able to do some physical task, instead of teasing her Sophie would help out or, if possible, try and teach her. 

Kara might have been the one with the most work to do. Watching the things that she said and making sure that, if it was too complicated, she explained it before moving on. In the end Sophie and Emily appreciated the explanations as well. They were older than Kara but sometimes she went over everyone&#39;s head.

You also had a new appreciation for the group as a whole. Both in the lives that they lead and the struggles they went through. You couldn&#39;t even imagine the number of times you&#39;d made Emily feel just like Miki had. So you did your best to be patient with her, even when she was being immature, or couldn&#39;t seem to understand something. That extended to the entire group when the occasion arose, though you always paid special attention to Miki on that point.

Another side benefit was the extra perspective you&#39;d been granted. You&#39;d had a week where you couldn&#39;t spell, could barely read, and didn&#39;t understand subtraction. Giving completely wrong answers with no hesitation, to no real consequences. High school was obviously a little harsher, but in the end all your mistakes and embarrassments were fleeting. The rest of the world would quickly forget, so why should you make yourself miserable and linger on it? Easier said than done of course, but you were improving.

Miki blossomed under the new circumstances, growing more confident with herself day by day. She still had her limitations, but that was just a matter of time. As she got older she&#39;d grow out of all of those &#39;babyish&#39; traits, there was just the annoying task of waiting it out. You&#39;d be there to see it all, the big brother to Emily that you always should have been, and the pseudo big brother to the rest. It&#39;d be a bumpy ride, but you were in it together.

You tipped the vial over, letting the liquid spill onto the floor, soaking into the carpet. Your mother suddenly appeared in your room as the last drop fell to the ground. There was a clear panic on her face, but when she met your eyes she began to calm.

She relaxed, holding her hand over her still pounding heart, @@.momVoice;&quot;I was worried that you&#39;d dropped it. Pulling it out of the carpet wouldn&#39;t have been easy. If you didn&#39;t want to drink it sweetie, you should have said so.&quot;@@

You were surprised by her words, you&#39;d thought she&#39;d be mad, or at least that she would demand an explanation. Instead she seemed almost relieved. It was enough that you couldn&#39;t even get your brain engaged properly. She knelt down to hold your hand as Emily also came running into the room. She spotting the empty vial in your still five year old hand, but she stayed quiet, at least for the moment.

@@.momVoice;&quot;I will love you no matter what. This is what you wanted to be and I support you with all my heart and love.&quot;@@

@@.momVoice;&quot;As long as you held that vial you had all the faculties of your 16 year old self.

Normal. Right, a five year old brain was your new normal now. Not that it bothered you, you couldn&#39;t remember having anything else. This was as smart and mature as you&#39;d ever been, probably. There was definitely a strange jump in your mind, where you&#39;d been a five year old boy until the start of this week, then &#39;&#39;bam&#39;&#39; Lilo-ified. 

It felt right though, to have those memories, as incongruous as they were. Though you didn&#39;t really want to linger on them. The idea of being a boy was @@.girlVoice;too weird@@ and you didn&#39;t want to try and compare yourself. What did it matter if the boy version of you had been smarter, or more athletic, or more mature? You were happy with who you were now.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;So I have a little sister now?&quot;@@ There was an excitement tinging Emily&#39;s voice as she asked the question. Your mother nodded in response and you once again found yourself engulfed in a hug from Emily, one your mom quickly joined. The start of the new version of your family.

[[The year marched on|Miki Low Happiness Ending Dump 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="717" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending Dump 3" tags="" position="850,8975" size="100,100">From there you quickly fell into a normal routine. Walking to school with Emily, seeing Miki at recess and coming home at lunch to mom. It took her a little bit to adjust as well. It&#39;d actually been the desired outcome of the sleepover, but she hadn&#39;t expected to be raising a live action Lilo. She loved it though. If she ever complained when you were in earshot she always followed it up by saying you were the @@.girlVoice;cutest little girl@@ in the world and pinching your nose. You always objected like you hated it, but you never actually tried to stop her.

The rest of the year went much the same as that first week, just without the meltdown. There were a few dramatic shifts, when the half day became an extended day, and then to a full day. However, you weathered that change quite well. There were a lot of things you weren&#39;t good at, but you were excellent at handling change. For your age you were actually impossibly good at it. Unfortunately you didn&#39;t get graded on &#39;ability to handle change&#39; and your actual grades were @@.girlVoice;middling at best@@. Good enough to get through, but with the teacher encouraging you get some extra support.

Luckily you had a whole network of girls who were around to assist. Kara was @@.girlVoice;unbelievably@@ smart and was a master of every single subject. Emily was basically just as smart, at least when it came to assisting in kindergarten learnings. And since you actually lived with her, she was your main source of assistance. 

Sophie tried to help sometimes, but her explanations weren&#39;t the best and she quickly got frustrated. You didn&#39;t ask for her help much. Miki knew the least overall technically, but she was only a year older that you, so all of this work was fresh in her mind. Plus she was the best at bringing the explanations down to your level.

Though it wasn&#39;t all work, their group of four had become a group of five and you all played together a lot. In the new group dynamic they did their best to make sure you and Miki were included. Though sometimes it was handy that the three of them could go do something @@.girlVoice;super complicated@@ while Miki and you did something @@.girlVoice;more fun@@.

[[The years went on|Miki Low Happiness Ending Dump 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="718" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending Dump 4" tags="" position="975,8975" size="100,100">As the years passed Miki ended up growing out of much of her youthful awkwardness. Shedding the last of her baby fat and catching up with the rest of her peers, mentally and physically. Originally her parents had been concerned about her lagging behind on some developmental milestones. Those concerns vanished over time and by age seven she was right on par. Her marks never excelled, but it was fairly smooth sailing in the middle of the pack.

You on the other hand had no such luck. Even by age ten you were @@.girlVoice;still struggling@@ with basically every class and you&#39;d gained quite a reputation for your @@.girlVoice;clumsiness@@. You&#39;d tried to work on it of course. Miki and you had even joined up for dance classes together when you were still only five. You were no good at most styles, however it had afforded you the opportunity to finally get your @@.girlVoice;hula outfit@@. That style you were shockingly good at, something that confused your instructor and brought Miki endless amusement.

The two of you were very close, even though you were never in the same class. Sometimes you actually thought you were closer to Miki than to your sister. Three years was a big age gap when you were both so young. Sometimes she just had &#39;better things to do&#39; than playing with you, much to your frustration. If you&#39;d remembered it this would have been deeply ironic, considering where this had all started. 

Your relationship with Emily improved as you both aged, the gap seeming less and less severe each year. By the time you&#39;d gotten into middle school the two of you were as close as could be. Not that anyone would believe you were related.

Once you got to high school things got even better. It was much easier to mingle with older students, so Miki and you could spend more time together.

You probably would have spent more time with the other girls, but they all had such busy lives to lead. Kara had been skipped forward a grade, but was still taking advanced classes. Emily seemed to be in every club the school had, and invented a few it didn&#39;t. 

Sophie was about to head to college on a gymnastics scholarship, so she spent a lot of time training. She also spent some time as a cheerleader. Emily teased her relentlessly about the girly outfit, but Sophie insisted it was just about the physical exercise. Although, even though it was optional, Sophie always wore her cheerleading garb on Spirit Days.

As much as the other girls said college was a blast, you loved your time in high school with Miki. Since you hadn&#39;t gotten heavily involved with clubs like Emily or Sophie you had a whole lot of free time on your hands. Free from all the stress and responsibility they&#39;d had to deal with. 

You wanted to say you spent the extra time studying...but you didn&#39;t. You had a ton of friends, and those friends had tons of parties. Between all those parties, weekends at the mall, and general hanging out you didn&#39;t have a lot of time for studying. Class was also usually terminally boring and you&#39;d become an expert at surreptitiously texting under your desk. Overall you really didn&#39;t like the whole &#39;school&#39; part of high school. 

It reflected in your marks, they were...well...they were bad. It&#39;d be enough to graduate, barely, but you weren&#39;t going to get into post-secondary. Miki was still debating on that herself, her marks were probably good enough, but she&#39;d have to work hard in her last year to have a proper chance.

But all that studying didn&#39;t stop the two of you from spending time on romantic pursuits. At first you&#39;d thought you only liked girls, but some time over the last few years boys had become &#39;&#39;very&#39;&#39; interesting as well. It was high school, so relationships never lasted long, but they were fun while they lasted. A fun that Miki enjoyed as well. 

Miki never had any trouble finding a boy. She was still a tiny girl, 5&#39; 1&quot; and a touch under 100 pounds, but lots of guys liked that. It helped that she&#39;d retained much of her sweet giggliness from when you&#39;d met her at six. A little @@.girlVoice;giggle@@ and a light touch on the arm and most guys were already hooked.

You were only a couple inches taller than her but you&#39;d ended up...what was word that boy had used before you dumped him? &#39;Thicc&#39;? But long legs and nice curves gave you your fair share of admirers, even if your thighs were a bit bigger than you wanted. 

Miki insisted your resemblance to Lilo had persisted all the way to teenagehood. You disagreed, but she had &#39;proof&#39;. Turned out there was a Lilo &amp; Stitch tv show, and there had been an episode where Lilo had turned into a teen. You&#39;d watched it with her, marvelling the similarities on display. Reflexively checking your own body as Lilo checked herself in a mirror. But you refused to admit that Miki was right, you couldn&#39;t give her the satisfaction.

Another thing you still both shared was dance. Though lately you&#39;d found yourself working more and more behind the scenes. You were having more fun doing all the other girl&#39;s makeup than actually going on stage to dance. Turned out hula wasn&#39;t popular enough locally to maintain a troupe.

[[Preparing for a performance|Miki Low Happiness Ending Dump 6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="720" name="Miki Low Happiness Ending Dump 6" tags="" position="1225,8975" size="100,100">@@.mikiVoice;&quot;Maybe you should do make-up professionally?&quot;@@ Miki suggested as you finished up her sparkly make-up. It was overdone, and some people might see that as a lack of skill on your part, but it was a lack of understanding on their part. Dance make-up always had to be overdone. It had to be noticeable not just to the people in the front row, but the people all the way in the back. So Miki looked a little silly up close, but you were confident it&#39;d look great on stage.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Hmmmm, that could work,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you&#39;d never really considered that possibility. You&#39;d treated it as something fun to do, but doing it for money was a whole new idea.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Ugh, you are so unfair. I didn&#39;t make out with him //that// much. Anyway. Mark and I aren&#39;t even dating anymore, and Noah is a much better kisser.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Oh shut up. You&#39;re no better. You and Mark only lasted a few weeks.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; And yes it was the same Mark. Miki had warned you he wasn&#39;t a great kisser, but he&#39;d been cute enough that you couldn&#39;t resist trying, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;same with Tommy...and Brad...and Aaron...\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

You let the rest of the list go unspoken. Miki just huffed and ignored the bait.

Anyone overhearing this conversation might think you hated each other, and were showing it by being catty. You knew better. You were the best of friends. It&#39;s just that you loved to tease each other, sometimes Miki made it so easy...not that you didn&#39;t give her plenty of ammunition to use against you. She was an equal opportunity teaser, she&#39;d find an angle no matter who you&#39;d been making out with, even when it&#39;d been that @@.girlVoice;super cute@@ cheerleader. It only got worse if you actually started dating them. 

The two of you continued teasing one another until it was finally Miki&#39;s turn to get on stage. You thought about how smart Miki was sometimes, her idea about being a make-up artist sounded great. After all Miki looked //great// up there and that was your handiwork. Maybe you could have a future in making everyone else look great too? It&#39;d be another big change in your life, but you were always able to ride the tides of change. Life went up and down, you were just along for the ride.

Sophie pondered on the point. Sometimes it was hard to tell exactly how Sophie felt about someone. She teased everyone whether she liked them or not. You figured that whatever she picked it would be something that gave her plenty of ammunition for that teasing. 

When she cracked a grin it did little to assuage that concern. Your mother leaned down to hear the verdict, Sophie whispered so that you wouldn&#39;t be able to hear. Wouldn&#39;t want to ruin the surprise after all.

@@.momVoice;&quot;An interesting choice. Not quite what I expected, but it does make sense,&quot;@@ your mother mused as she turned back to you. You were half convinced she&#39;d said that just to keep you off balance and concerned. However, the look currently on her face showed her taking this situation rather seriously. Sophie had made the suggestion, but your mother had her own plans and reasons for this.

For now though you were going to have to have to deal with whatever the two of them had cooked up. She moved her hands in an arcane gesture before pushing it out towards you. The tingles broke out on your skin immediately. Nothing to do now but see what happened.

[[Consider the changes|Sophie High Happiness Ending 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="722" name="Sophie High Happiness Ending 2" tags="" position="225,9100" size="100,100">A pleasant warmth suffused your whole body, spreading to every part of you. Currently there didn&#39;t seem to be anything changing. It made you think about how the magic would actually work. It wasn&#39;t as simple as just giving you long hair and shrinking your arms and legs. There were internals to rearrange and hormones to balance. Did it actually rewrite your DNA? You couldn&#39;t even imagine the complexity of that, but did mom actually know all that? Or did the magic just handle the fine details on its own?

None of this mattered. When faced the the imminent loss of your gender and maturity, you&#39;d gotten overly analytical, if only to distract yourself. You turned your attention inward, you wondered if you would be able to feel the changes inside you as they happened. What was the sound of your insides turning inside out? Was there a sensation to your chromosomes flipping? Or would you not even be able to detect it as your brain shrank down?

Frustrated by the lack of understanding of what was happening inside of you, you turned your attention back to your outsides. The girls were all watching in fascination as the changes began to manifest on you. 

[[Weather the changes|Sophie High Happiness Ending 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="723" name="Sophie High Happiness Ending 3" tags="" position="350,9100" size="100,100">Once the power had suffused your body all the changes seemed to happen at one. Your insides had changed and now the rest of the body was forced to follow suit. Your vision warped as you dropped towards the floor, dozens of pounds shedding off of you, disappearing into nothing. Maybe in some alternate universe there was a version of you who kept gaining weight but could never figure out why. 

It wasn&#39;t clear exactly how small you were going to get. Eyeballing things you were already Sophie&#39;s size and getting smaller. Though it wasn&#39;t just your height that changed, many of those shed pounds were coming from your muscles. A feeling of weakness flooded through you. In your minds eye you tried to imagine what you could lift now. Maybe you&#39;d be able to handle those little pink one pound weights, but that was about it and that might be a struggle.

Everything about you felt small and weak, a feeling that continued to intensify even as your body stopped shrinking. Mercifully you seemed to still be a little bigger than Miki, but even Kara was bigger than you now. Internally you groaned, she was only 4 feet tall, which meant you were under...

There was also a change to your skin, it was becoming paler than before. You weren&#39;t turning albino, but it looked like you weren&#39;t well acquainted with the sun. The little spots started to appear, at first just a few but they quickly spread everywhere. You couldn&#39;t see it but your face was now covered in freckles. Auburn hair fell across your vision, bouncing in a messy curl.

@@.girlThought;She&#39;s so big, she&#39;s practically an adult.@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I&#39;m, uh, fine. Thank you for asking.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Your politeness only made Sophie smile wider.

@@.girlThought;She has such a pretty smile.@@

Mom took a moment to interject, @@.momVoice;&quot;Perhaps we should get &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; something to wear other than an oversized man&#39;s shirt.&quot;@@

The other girls nodded, moving back towards Emily&#39;s room.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Come on,&quot;@@ she grabbed your hand, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;time to get you dressed.&quot;@@

@@.girlThought;She&#39;s so mature, I better just follow along.@@

[[You went upstairs|Sophie High Happiness Ending 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="725" name="Sophie High Happiness Ending 5" tags="" position="600,9100" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/SophieLow/Day0Outfit.webp&#39; &quot;topRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Sitting on Emily&#39;s bed you watched as the girls rifled through Emily&#39;s closet. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt;= 12&gt;&gt;This wasn&#39;t the first time you&#39;d been dressed up, but this time Sophie seemed to be taking the lead.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Sophie was taking the lead on the hunt for something more befitting your new stature.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; It seemed that since she got to choose your physical form, she wanted to pick your outfit as well.

@@.girlThought;Sophie is so smart, she probably knows better anyway.@@

In the moments before they settled on something you were able to take a few moments to take stock of the situation. It seems Sophie had wanted you as a seven year old red head. It made you look more like her sister than Emily&#39;s, though your hair was a duller red, and you had more freckles. So the physical form was simple enough, but what about your mind? Maybe it&#39;d be best to ask her about it.

@@.girlThought;Better not. She&#39;s busy and it&#39;s not that important.@@

You straightened in shock. It&#39;d been happening for a few minutes, but you just realized that your internal monologue wasn&#39;t consistent. There was another voice, well it was still your voice, but it was encouraging you down a different path. Was this the seven year old girl part of your brain chiming in?

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;How about this?&quot;@@ Sophie held up a dress for your inspection. It was bright pink, with flowers sprouting from the hemlines. The sleeves were white but absolutely covered in butterflies and flowers. There was a visible pocket on the front, the same style as the sleeves.

@@.girlThought;It&#39;s really cute, I should try it on.@@

[[You tried to ignore the thought|Sophie High Happiness Ending 6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="726" name="Sophie High Happiness Ending 6" tags="" position="725,9100" size="100,100">You tried to ignore that thought. It was @@.girlVoice;cute@@, but it was also aggressively girly and childish. It was in your size, but you could imagine seeing a toddler in the same outfit.

@@.girlThought;But Sophie picked it just for me. It would be rude not to try it.@@

You found yourself reaching out for the dress before you could think better of it. With it in your hands the urge to try it grew even stronger. You capitulated. If you were going to have to fight your own mind you&#39;d have to pick your battles, you needed an actual outfit, this would have to do.

Though once you got it on you reconsidered the situation. The style made it seem like you were still wearing an oversized shirt. Though now the hem stopped mid-thigh and the sleeves actually fit properly. It made you look even smaller than you were.

@@.girlThought;I&#39;m so adorable.@@

It was @@.girlVoice;cute@@, @@.girlVoice;too cute@@. You already looked a little small for seven, a dress like this made you look Miki&#39;s age, or maybe even younger.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Very cute,&quot;@@ Sophie spoke and a pleasant sensation washed over you, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;what do you think?&quot;@@

Your mind was still recovering from the compliment, @@.girlThought;Sophie is so nice@@, and it degraded your ability to object, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I agree, It&#39;s very cute.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; The fact that you weren&#39;t sure if you wanted to look cute was left unspoken. 

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;With that settled why don&#39;t we play some more until everyone&#39;s parents come?&quot;@@

[[Downstairs to play|Sophie High Happiness Ending 7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="727" name="Sophie High Happiness Ending 7" tags="" position="850,9100" size="100,100">The rest of the morning was spent playing a haphazard assortment of games, none lasting more than a few minutes. Though the situation was rather illuminating to you. You were starting to understand exactly what Sophie had done to you.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Well done &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;!&quot;@@ Sophie called after you&#39;d scored. Once again the pleasant feeling assaulted you, leaving you with a @@.girlVoice;dopey grin@@.

Though Sophie immediately one up&#39;d you with a far more impressive goal.

@@.girlThought;Sophie&#39;s so amazing.@@

You shook your head. The theme was becoming clear now. Yes it was a &#39;normal&#39; little girl voice that just wanted you to be @@.girlVoice;cute and have fun@@. But there was a second aspect that seemed to be in total awe of Sophie. Whenever she did anything, regardless of how impressive it was, the voice felt the need gush over it. Then again Sophie was awfully impressive compared to you. Sure you were younger than her but she seemed so strong and fast and...you cut off that line of thinking, you didn&#39;t need to add fuel to the fire.

It was almost a relief when Sophie&#39;s mom came to pick her up. On the one hand, you didn&#39;t want to see her go, you wanted to keep playing. On the other you hoped that with her gone you&#39;d be able to clear your head.

Luckily you&#39;d correctly deduced the situation. With Sophie gone the voice seemed to go almost entirely silent, leaving you alone with your own thoughts. Unfortunately, those thoughts were preoccupied with the fact you were going to wake up this way tomorrow. A skinny little seven year old red-headed girl...that had to go to grade school.

[[First day of school|Sophie High Happiness Ending 8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="728" name="Sophie High Happiness Ending 8" tags="" position="975,9100" size="100,100">You shifted uncomfortably in your seat. It was deeply strange to be back in grade two, doubly so because this time you were in a skirt. Mercifully Emily had gone easier on you this morning. It was inarguably a girl&#39;s outfit, but at least it made you look your age. There was a part of you that was very worried about what the other kids thought of you. You were only going to be there for a week, so you shouldn&#39;t care, but...

@@.girlThought;I want them to like me.@@

You couldn&#39;t disagree on that point, and at Emily&#39;s urging you introduced yourself to the rest of the class. Emily and Kara were comforting presences in the room, you weren&#39;t the best of friends but you knew they were on your side.

Your mind had regressed enough that the school work was challenging, but nothing you couldn&#39;t handle. Everything was calm enough until lunch. Outside all the grades were able to mix and mingle, which put you back in direct contact with Sophie.

Or it would have if she didn&#39;t get dragged into an impromptu soccer game. A game that you were helplessly drawn to, you simply had to watch. Your attention rapt on the game as it progressed, though Sophie took up an abnormal amount of your focus.

@@.girlThought;She&#39;s so good at this.@@

There was a moment, while Sophie was carrying the ball, that one of the boys slid in for an aggressive tackle. He missed the ball but clipped Sophie&#39;s foot. You held your breath as she stumbled, but she recovered and still kept possession of the ball, @@.girlThought;it was amazing@@.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Go Sophie!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You shouted as she dribbled her way towards the goal. Your awareness expanded enough to notice that you&#39;d drew the stares of half of the yard with your outburst. You blushed and went quiet, it was just a silly playground game, Sophie didn&#39;t need a cheerleader. Though it didn&#39;t stop you from cheering when she did score. 

The bell rang and you were all forced back inside, never even getting a chance to congratulate her on the win.

[[The week went on|Sophie High Happiness Ending 9]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="729" name="Sophie High Happiness Ending 9" tags="" position="1100,9100" size="100,100">It became clear as the week went on that you&#39;d been afflicted with a serious case of &#39;hero worship&#39;, heroine in this case. You idolized Sophie, you couldn&#39;t help yourself. She just seemed so impossibly perfect in everything she did. You knew consciously that you were ignoring anything negative that didn&#39;t fit that image. But the moment she did something impressive you revered her even more. Which meant that her compliments, even her attention, made you melt into childish reverence.

In the quieter moments you were able to clear the thoughts from your head, but other times you @@.girlThought;wanted to be just like her@@. It had become a little more difficult to separate your own thoughts from that intrusive voice. It was a deeply conflicting situation. Was it worth fighting that voice when you&#39;d be back to normal in a week anyway?

Sophie hadn&#39;t explained her plan to the other girls, so they had to find out by watching your odd sycophantic behaviour. When she worked it out Emily was deeply annoyed.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;She&#39;s supposed to be my little sister. Why does she like Sophie so much?&quot;@@ Emily pouted, folding her arms.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;Well,&quot;@@ Kara was trying her best to defuse the potential conflict, @@.karaVoice;&quot;Sophie and &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; did get along really well at the party. They probably just wanted to play with each other for a little longer, it&#39;s only a week after all.&quot;@@

This rationale was enough to mollify Emily, though she was still disappointed at her missed opportunity to be a big sister. Your own feelings on the matter continued to drift. At the start of the week you&#39;d thought of it as a bit of a prank. Make you into a little girl so you could get even more experience seeing how @@.girlVoice;amazing she was@@, but now you were really starting to see it as a blessing.

As a teenager you&#39;d grown a lot more cynical about people. Everyone had their flaws, worshipping your heroes was bound to get your heart broken. But your mind was a lot simpler now. So it was easy to believe @@.girlThought;Sophie was actually perfect@@ and not let anything shatter that faith. Might as well enjoy it while it lasted.

So you did, you followed her lead on everything. Doing whatever she suggested and having way more fun than if you&#39;d made your own decisions.

[[End of the week|Sophie High Happiness Ending 10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="730" name="Sophie High Happiness Ending 10" tags="" position="1225,9100" size="100,100">On Saturday the girls were coming over again, though this time it was just for the daytime. At this point your devotion had reached it&#39;s peak. You basically acted as Sophie&#39;s shadow all day, lapsing into unrestrained awe when she did something even moderately impressive. 

@@.girlThought;She&#39;s so strong and beautiful. I wish I could be like that.@@

The other girls teased you about the behaviour, but Sophie was loving all the attention. It had been her wish after all.

Your heart skipped a beat, @@.girlThought;she wished for me! All the choice in the world and she picked me!@@

Though you weren&#39;t concious of it your internal monologue had almost entirely harmonized. There wasn&#39;t &#39;another&#39; voice telling you how amazing Sophie was. You didn&#39;t need anyone to tell you that. 

The activities of the day just reinforced it further. Every time the two of you &#39;competed&#39; that day you&#39;d found yourself outdone by her. In truth it wasn&#39;t really much of a competition. But you didn&#39;t mind losing, since it was her.

@@.girlThought;I could never beat her, she&#39;s just too good.@@

Kara slyly commented to Sophie that maybe your outlook was causing you to sabotage your own attempts, but Sophie waved it off. Sophie was riding high on the adoration and wanted to enjoy it while she had it. She wasn&#39;t abusing that fact too much, she wasn&#39;t teasing you and wasn&#39;t ordering you around much, she just enjoyed having you around.

It was almost strange to hear her say it that way. &#39;If&#39;. Was it possible you could never turn back at all?

Your attempt was weak and you knew it; you didn&#39;t want to turn back. The intrusive voice in your head had been gone for days. All that praise and adoration had been provided solely by you. At the party she&#39;d been impressive, and the two of you had gotten really friendly. But seeing her so much this week, how she acted and what she was capable of...your respect had turned into idolization.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Sophie!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Okay, that //was// a little extreme. You&#39;d let yourself build a habit of putting her on a pedestal, very nearly worshipping her. So you could go a little over the top, but that didn&#39;t mean you wanted to change anything.

It turned out that Sophie had been half wrong. She was right that you weren&#39;t going to be her own personal cheerleader, but that didn&#39;t mean you weren&#39;t going to give the girls all the support you could.

Your time at their level had made it abundantly clear how amazing this group was. Sophie was a star athlete, Kara was a genius, Miki had endless potential and Emily was a literal witch in training. Individually they&#39;d be able to accomplish wonderful things, but together they could do almost anything. It almost seemed like your responsibility to help support them all. You could be the supportive big brother to all of them. In a literal sense for Emily of course, but Kara and Sophie didn&#39;t have an older brother at all.

Of course your relationship with Emily improved greatly, and you grew closer with the other girls, but even your high school relationships improved.

It had occurred by happen-stance on one of your group excursions to the mall. The five of you had been in a kid&#39;s clothing store looking at various girly outfits. Though you didn&#39;t have the greatest insight the girls had taken to asking you your opinions on the relative cuteness of different @@.girlVoice;skirts@@ and @@.girlVoice;dresses@@. This is when you&#39;d been caught by a gaggle of your female classmates. 

You&#39;d been concerned that they&#39;d think you were weird or tease you, that you&#39;d be a social pariah after then...but they&#39;d been incredibly supportive. They bemoaned their own brothers. The boys absolute distaste for anything they even remotely considered girly. They would have //loved// to have a brother they could take shopping, if only to help carry their bags.

By the end of the conversation you&#39;d received an invite for another shopping trip the next day, this time with girls your age. It was more similar than you&#39;d expected. At first there had been a little big of awkwardness, but by the end you were entirely part of the group.

This sort of trip became routine and you found yourself at the mall multiple times a week. Sometimes with your sister and her friends, sometimes with your own high school group.

There was one major distinction in the shopping trips. Emily and co were almost entirely concerned about what they thought about the outfit. The girls your age were //very// interested in how the other boys at school would feel about their outfits. There was a shocking amount of @@.girlVoice;gossip@@ regarding the various relationships blossoming and withering at school.

In the end you saw a lot more half naked girls than //any// other guy at school. But in those moments you were determining if the swimsuit suited the figure or if the bra was the right size, rather than ogling. More than once you&#39;d ended up getting questioned about panty choices, they just //loved// seeing you get all blushy about it. You were &#39;one of the girls&#39;, according to the consensus of the group. Something that would have galled the old you, but now felt entirely natural. 

It was equally natural that you started to pick up a few of their interests. Your inclination towards @@.girlVoice;fashion@@ was obvious enough, but the @@.girlVoice;pop music@@ was a new one. So was an increasing love of @@.girlVoice;trashy sitcoms@@. They&#39;d even managed to convince you to start your own @@.girlVoice;Instagram@@ account. You didn&#39;t post much but pictures of the group, but it was a start.

This also did wonders for your social life at school in general. You hadn&#39;t realized, but you&#39;d somehow fallen in with the popular girls. The kind who never would have even spoken to the old you. Which meant every guy in the school was buttering you up trying to get information about how to get a hook up. Something you generally denied, you didn&#39;t mind them being pushy, but you had to defend your girls. However, the occasional guy was cute enough to give him a shot. Those relationships never lasted long anyway, so dumb but cute would suit the girls just fine.

Though this wasn&#39;t without consequences. With your increased social life you&#39;d lost time for some of your old activities. You never got a chance to go to the gym anymore, which caused much of your hard earned muscle to fade away. Though Cadence had given you a quick but effective home routine that you managed to work in every day. It was a little more focused on your butt than you&#39;d expected, but you couldn&#39;t deny the results.

Which is how you found yourself once again in the mall, your opinion being requested on the latest cute dress. Except this dress was for you. Your wardrobe was dreadfully small and you couldn&#39;t keep borrowing their stuff forever.

It was a development that your elementary school friend group also enthusiastically supported. Emily providing you with unfettered access to her closet. You took less advantage of it than you&#39;d expect, sure everything fit, but it was an eight year old&#39;s wardrobe. Sure some of her shirts and skirts were cute enough when sized up, but you didn&#39;t want to be //that// cutesy.

Which is why you declined the current dress on offer. You wanted something a little more elegant this time, something your friends were more than happy to help with. After all they had a plan to &#39;accidentally&#39; run into some of their crushes a bit later, and it was important that all of you looked your best.

You knew you were going to get flirted with, again, by a boy who didn&#39;t have the whole story, but that was kind of fun too. Who didn&#39;t like getting a little attention sometimes? Maybe some day you&#39;d take things a little further than that, but you hadn&#39;t decided yet. 

You sighed. //The things they drag me into.// But you still smiled, you loved all your friends, high jinks and all. Plus the sleepover crew would get a kick out of the story, though it still made you blush when Sophie made fun of you for being so @@.girlVoice;girly@@. You knew she wasn&#39;t wrong per say, you //were// about to put on a dress, but...you didn&#39;t know where this was going...enough thinking, time to get going. The group was on the move and you all had some fun to have.

It should have been an unthinkable thing to admit, but you knew how much you wanted it. You didn&#39;t care what other people thought. Just this once you&#39;d stand your ground even if Sophie disagreed.

She didn&#39;t. Nor did mom.

@@.momVoice;&quot;If that&#39;s what you want sweetie,&quot;@@ the seriousness of her tone had disappeared entirely, @@.momVoice;&quot;I just wanted to make sure you knew the gravity of your choice. If you&#39;re so willing to stand up for it despite my disapproval, I know you mean it.&quot;@@

You squealed in delight and threw your arms around both of them, or at least your best attempt to do so, you were awfully small. All the tension had dropped out of you. Mom //was// happy with the decision, she&#39;d just been testing you, and you&#39;d passed. Or at least you were treating this as passing.

The rest of the evening and the subsequent morning were a whirr of activity. It wasn&#39;t too difficult to convince people you were staying for another week; making it a permanent arrangement was significantly more onerous. However, Mom had seemingly endless connections, between that and some judiciously applied magic, it wasn&#39;t long before your registration was official and you&#39;d be attending elementary school full time.

The other girls were excited by the sudden addition to their group. You&#39;d all gotten along alright at the party, but last week they&#39;d met a whole new you. Emily did have some reservations. Between your auburn hair and freckles you still looked more like Sophie&#39;s little sister than hers. @@.girlThought;I wish I was Sophie&#39;s little sister.@@ But mom reassured her that you were in fact her @@.girlVoice;little sister@@, that she was now a @@.girlVoice;big sister@@. The change in title enough to make Emily happy for the moment.

And thus life went on. All of you going to school together, Kara, Emily and you even being in the same class. Every lunch you spent your time with Sophie; acting as her personal cheerleader for sports and games. Of course you took part sometimes, but you enjoyed watching more than playing. It didn&#39;t help that you weren&#39;t particularly athletic. Your academics weren&#39;t much better. You weren&#39;t in danger of failing, but you were a distinctively mediocre student on all counts.

[[The year went on|Sophie High Happiness Ending 17]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="741" name="Sophie High Happiness Ending 17" tags="" position="100,9350" size="100,100">Now that everything had been settled and you were officially Emily&#39;s @@.girlVoice;little sister@@ things settled into a nice routine. School was boring, but it didn&#39;t bother you much, you still had plenty of fun the rest of the time. You had your @@.girlVoice;big sister@@ Emily, your mom, Miki, Kara and of course your mentor and idol Sophie. All the friends you could ever want.

Though it didn&#39;t stop you from making other friends, both in your grade and among the older girls. Since you spent so much time with Sophie you also ended up making friends with her friends. This trend continued for years, until it was time for Sophie to graduate to high school. Since you were two years apart it meant you&#39;d been attending different schools for a while. 

Sophie wasn&#39;t the only one who was gone, all of her friends had graduated as well. So you&#39;d lost a massive chunk of your social circle. You still had friends in middle school, but not too many. Your constant companion was now someone you could only see on evenings and weekends.

You felt aimless, however, this forced you to confront the realities of your relationship with Sophie. Until now you&#39;d practically worshipped the ground she&#39;d walked on. But that was childish hero worship. It&#39;d been cute when you were eight and she was ten, but you were thirteen now, that kind of devotion just plain creepy. 

More than that you realized it was all one sided. Sophie could do all these amazing things, but what could you do? You were always there to cheer for her, but was it really enough just to cheer? You wanted to be the kind of girl who was worthy of Sophie&#39;s attention, not some charity case.

You took the intervening years to begin that journey. Of course you still saw Sophie, but being at different schools meant you had a lot more time apart from her. This allowed you to do some of the work surreptitiously, so you could surprise her when you were reunited. It was a relief and a delight when you finally became a freshmen and joined her in high school.

Actually she was basically the &#39;alpha&#39; of one of those groups, specifically the cheerleaders. Sophie was the captain of the squad, her gymnastics training giving her a natural aptitude for the sport. Sophie had also become a lot more comfortable with her own femininity; you wouldn&#39;t call her &#39;girly&#39;, but she knew how good she looked in a cheer uniform.

So good in fact that it was almost frustrating. She had blossomed into a full figured woman, tall and lithe. Meanwhile you&#39;d hit puberty late and even then it seemed like your chest wasn&#39;t getting the message. Mom said you just had to be patient, that the family had &quot;good genes&quot;. You weren&#39;t convinced you had those genes at all, you didn&#39;t look like your mom or sister at all. Over the years you&#39;d gotten real tired of insisting that you weren&#39;t adopted.

Reunited with Sophie it was easy for you to slip into her posse. You weren&#39;t athletic enough to join cheer, but you found your place. One of the talents you&#39;d acquired over the last few years was a passing knowledge of medicine. You weren&#39;t a nurse or anything, but you&#39;d picked up some useful tips from Kara and her mom. Since cheerleading was a never-ending parade of bumps, scrapes and sprains, your talents came in very handy. You couldn&#39;t count the number of times you&#39;d had to tend to the newest of Sophie&#39;s injuries. She was tough, but not invulnerable, as you continually tried to remind her. Though you knew she&#39;d never listen, so you always kept a small first aid kit in your backpack.

Perhaps not surprisingly some of cheerleaders abused their position. Being on cheer made them popular, and they thought it made them better than others. Something they let others know, including you. But only when Sophie wasn&#39;t in ear shot. Sophie didn&#39;t approve of that kind of teasing and let everyone know it. One girl had been run off of the team when she wouldn&#39;t clamp down on the behavior. Sophie herself didn&#39;t need to insult other to pump her ego, she radiated a natural aura of self confidence. Some called it arrogance, but you knew better. Sophie didn&#39;t self aggrandize about how amazing she was, but she didn&#39;t downplay her successes either.

That was a part of why you admired her so much, one of many reasons. You weren&#39;t a child anymore, so you didn&#39;t idolize her quite so utterly, but you still had a deep admiration for her. Your youthful desire to be more like her slowly morphed into something else entirely. As you&#39;d both pushed into teenagehood you&#39;d realized this shift, though it took you some time to identify what it was.

Kara had been the first one you confided in, being the most discreet of the group. That you thought your feelings for Sophie might be more than platonic. In response she&#39;d shown you a litany of high school anime with schoolgirls who were...close...with each other...very close...embarrassingly, blush inducingly close. Though discussion with her, a full watch of Madoka, Utena and Sakura Trick, and lots of self introspection you confirmed your initial suspicions.

[[Freshman year continued|Sophie High Happiness Ending 19]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="743" name="Sophie High Happiness Ending 19" tags="" position="350,9350" size="100,100">This realization, that your feelings for Sophie were turning romantic, caused an internal crisis. What would you do with the information? The idea of telling Sophie was entirely out of the question. The possibility of rejection was more than enough to keep you quiet, but you still wanted to find ways to show your affection.

Inspired by Kara&#39;s anime education you worked on improving your cooking skills. Sophie often forgot to bring enough for lunch, neglecting the fact she burned so much energy with her endless athletics, so you started bringing things for her. At first it was just little snacks, something to help bridge the gap to dinner, but it progressed into making entire lunches. You had a private joy every time she smiled at seeing one of your home cooked meals and barely concealed joy when she complimented it. It made all those early mornings worth it.

You&#39;d even tried to pick up a little magic to see if it would help, but to no avail. It seemed you had little aptitude for it, and lacked the &#39;force of will&#39; to do even the most basic cantrip. 

That didn&#39;t stop you from being helpful in other ways, your first aid skills were improving almost every day. Though those moments where you were cheek to cheek with Sophie tending to some bruise, took on a whole new meaning. More than once you&#39;d had to hurriedly run off when the contact became too much to bear and your blushing was far too obvious. Sometimes you swore that Sophie was doing it intentionally. That she was purposely leaning into you or brushing her hand against your skin. Once you&#39;d been //sure// she was going to kiss you, only for her to pull back at the last second. 

You&#39;d convinced yourself that you were just projecting your own wishes onto her, but the rest of the girls thought differently. Emily in particular encouraged you to at least //ask// Sophie about it. Your sister was far more bold than you were, always pushing you outside of your comfort zone, even about something as terrifying as admitting your feelings to Sophie.

[[Junior year|Sophie High Happiness Ending 20]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="744" name="Sophie High Happiness Ending 20" tags="" position="475,9350" size="100,100">Which is why you now found yourself, starting your second year, standing under a tree, letter in hand, waiting for Sophie to arrive. Kara had insisted this was the right way to do, though you were suspicious she&#39;d let anime influence her too much. Still the idea of handing Sophie a love letter under a tree, even if it wasn&#39;t a sakura tree, was too romantic to ignore.

Your heart leapt as you saw her in the distance, clutching the letter so hard you started to crumple it, heart pounding in your ears. She smiled and waved as she spotted you, nearly melting you on the spot. The anxiety rising in you with her every step towards you.

She stood before you, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;&lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;. What&#39;s up? You look so nervous.&quot;@@ She moved even closer to get a better look at you, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m //that// scary. Mean Sophie is just for the other girls on the squad, you know I&#39;m always nice to you.&quot;@@ The smile she gave you threatened to destroy what little resolve you had. You would do anything to keep seeing that smile.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Sophie I-I...\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you tried to steady your trembling voice, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;the reason I called you out here is-is to..to...\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you almost faltered, barely managing to spit out &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;to give you this,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; before your voice failed you entirely. You held out the letter, sealed with an obvious heart. This had all gone much more smoothly in your head. Instead of being all cool and romantic you were so nervous that you couldn&#39;t even look at her, and you could feel your face getting redder by the moment.

Instead stepping in closer to you, reflexively you backed up, bumping into the tree, she leaned down to you, lips only inches from yours.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;You&#39;re so cute when you blush.&quot;@@ 

You just about died. Any response you could have had died in your throat.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;But so dramatic,&quot;@@ she held up the letter, idly examining it before looking back to you, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;Kara suggested this didn&#39;t she?&quot;@@

You swallowed and nodded.

Sophie laughed, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;Of course she did. She&#39;s always trying to come up with the clever solution. I much prefer the direct approach.&quot;@@

Before you could react she leaned in and kissed you. If this had been an anime, this was the part where steam would have shot out of your ears and hearts would appear in your eyes. It disappointingly didn&#39;t happen in reality, but you later told the story like it had. Time froze and you hoped it would never unfreeze. 

Sophie broke the kiss, a blush having crept onto her own cheeks. You reflexively leaned forward, following her lips, but she was too quick. You fell forward, leaning into her chest, you could feel her heart pounding. 

She scratched the back of her head, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;though I guess I can&#39;t blame you too much. I kept teasing you, but could never quite say it out loud...&quot;@@ Her blush deepened, God she was even prettier when she blushed. 

The two of you stood there leaning into each other, hearts pounding. As a leaf fell from the tree and in that moment anyone watching would have seen a cherry blossom float through the air. This time you leaned up to kiss her. A kiss she eagerly accepted. Sophie had wished for you and in return you&#39;d gotten more than you could ever ask for.

You grimaced as Sophie considered her options. As far as you were aware there were no limitations about what she could do. Mom likely wouldn&#39;t let her do anything that was actively harmful, but as long as you were a normalish little girl, she&#39;d probably agree to it. The fact that Sophie was taking a while to decide might mean she didn&#39;t have anything particularly devious, or potentially she had something incredibly devious and wanted to plan it out as well as possible.

Finally she beckoned your mother to lean down, whispering her final decision into her ear. Mom smiled, @@.momVoice;&quot;yes. I think that would be very appropriate.&quot;@@ She turned back to you and her smile only widened. You quailed at her gaze, was she was enjoying this? This all seemed a little extreme to encourage you to get along better with Emily. You&#39;d save questioning her parenting style until you were back to normal.

She began to wave her hands and chant, a gentle glow flowing from her hands over to you. Tingles began to flow across your body, making the hairs rise on the back of your neck. There was nothing you could do but watch as the changes washed over your body.

[[Weather the changes|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="747" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 2" tags="" position="850,9350" size="100,100">One thing you had to appreciate in all of this was that the changes never really hurt. There was some discomfort to be sure, but that was more your own mental discomfort rather than physical. Hell, plenty of times during the party you hadn&#39;t even noticed that changes had occurred until after you&#39;d had a moment to reflect.

This time though there was nothing else to focus on, so you were able to take in as it happened. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;You&#39;d never actually gotten as young as the girls, but you got the feeling you were about to.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;d already regressed down to their age before, so you had some idea of what to expect.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

There was something a little different about this transformation, but you couldn&#39;t quite put your finger on it. You watched as your entire body slimmed down. Once again losing those hard earned muscles, though it was currently beneath your notice that it wasn&#39;t accompanied by the same feelings of weakness you&#39;d had before. Your limbs looked long and supple, at least compared to your decreasing stature. There was something oddly fascinating about watching every hair fall out of your arm, but then disappear before it hit the floor. It seemed that mom had ensured the magic didn&#39;t make too much of a mess.

Your arms and legs had become smooth long before the transformation had actually finished. Something you were able to confirm when your pants suddenly fell down. You&#39;d hurriedly grabbed at them, but your arms weren&#39;t the length you&#39;d expected; despite how quick you&#39;d been you missed the grab. Luckily your shirt now served as a sort of dress. For a moment it was a dangerously short dress, but that quickly changed. Covering you all the way down to your knees. It was a slightly annoying situation, surely mom could have made it so your clothes changed with you. If you could change a human being, how hard could some fabric be? Then again this was supposed to be a punishment so perhaps that was part of it.

[[The changes continued|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 3]]
&lt;&lt;set $playerAge to 11&gt;&gt;\</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="748" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 3" tags="" position="975,9350" size="100,100">You were stuck in your impromptu dress as the changes finished washing over you. Your body had shrunk down before a lot of the other details about you had changed. You could feel a tickle of hair on your back, pulling a strand around you were able to watch as it changed from it&#39;s normal dark brown to a bright blonde. The same color as your sister, but not the same as your mother&#39;s. You&#39;d always wondered where in the family tree it came from. Though the length was more annoying than the color. If you didn&#39;t style it, it&#39;d end up flying all over the place whenever you moved. You didn&#39;t want that kind of hassle.

Your face tingled, making changes that you couldn&#39;t see but seemed to be fascinating the others. There was a momentary blur in your vision, forcing you to blink. When you re-opened them your bright blue eyes met Sophie sparkling green ones. Her eyes looked dangerous, it looked like she was looking for a fight. Not that you were in any condition to fight, your legs felt steadier now but that didn&#39;t mean you were ready for a dust up. Not that you had any reason to fight Sophie, but something in her eyes made you want to challenge her.

That strange feeling held on even as your body settled into it&#39;s final form. You felt small and delicate, but that was in relation to your perceptions as a sixteen year old boy. By the look in Miki&#39;s eyes she was rather more impressed with the result. Such a point of pride, having a six year old think you cut an impressive figure, you wanted to see that same look in Sophie&#39;s eye, now that would mean something.

Your best guess was that you&#39;d ended up the same age as Sophie. A quick glance confirmed that she was a touch taller than you, but not by much. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;You weren&#39;t exactly sure how a nine year old girl body was supposed to feel, but this seemed normal enough.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;d been this age before, but it felt rather more normal this time.

For example, you no longer had @@.girlVoice;cat ears@@.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; If anything, it was a little suspicious. Sophie had clearly made a distinct request and &#39;make &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; nine&#39;, didn&#39;t seem like it would fit the bill. Which meant there was something else going on.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Okay Sophie, what&#39;s the catch?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Catch?&quot;@@ She did her best innocent look, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;You&#39;re just an entirely normal nine year old girl.&quot;@@

You narrowed your eyes at her, but she didn&#39;t budge. You were confident she was messing with you, but she wasn&#39;t forthcoming with any more information. You&#39;d have to figure out any weirdnesses on your own. For now you were stuck with this body. So you shrugged and walked back to finish your breakfast. You could work on getting a proper outfit afterwards. Right now you were hungry.

The walk revealed one additional feeling. Your body felt //great//. It felt like your entire being was thrumming with energy. You knew kids had more energy, but this was on another level. You wanted to run and jump through a field, leaping chasms and climbing mountains, and it felt like you&#39;d be able to do it. It was hard to compare to the old you, but it felt like you might actually be fitter than before. You weren&#39;t &#39;strong&#39;, after all you were nine, but you didn&#39;t feel weak either. Strange. Hard to know if that was normal for this form, or part of Sophie&#39;s plot. Either way, food first, concerns later.

During breakfast you tried to prod Sophie for more information but the best you got was @@.sophieVoice;&quot;Oh, we&#39;re gonna have fun this week you and me.&quot;@@ She wouldn&#39;t elaborate any further. You doubted it would stop at just getting stuck in grade 4 again. You couldn&#39;t remember much about what sort of work you&#39;d have, but you figured that part would work itself out.

After breakfast mom insisted that you get something to wear that wasn&#39;t an oversized men&#39;s t-shirt, threatening to slip off of your shoulders. Sophie and Emily were more than happy to oblige the request. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt;=12&gt;&gt;Once again going through Emily&#39;s magic closet for something that fit the bill.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;d thought that whatever they picked would be too small, since you were still bigger than Emily, but it seemed a little magic smoothed that over.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; 

Though they didn&#39;t stop there. You had an entire week ahead of you, which meant at least six outfits. Though neither you nor Sophie had the patience to do all of that now. Plus Sophie said that since the two of you were so closely sized you&#39;d also be able to borrow her clothes. Perhaps it was that influence which ensured your new outfit wasn&#39;t as girly as you&#39;d expected. Yes it was a purple shirt with a rainbow unicorn and yes it was a denim skirt with a floral belt but...okay you had to admit that your baseline had clearly drifted if this didn&#39;t count as girly. Still, you&#39;d seen Emily in much girlier outfits and she could have picked any of them. 

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Hmmm. Cute enough, I suppose it&#39;ll have to do for now.&quot;@@

You quirked an eyebrow. Sophie was acting so strangely. Then again strange was a relative term when you&#39;d just had your gender swapped and age regressed. You were sure you&#39;d figure it out eventually. The two of you had been fairly friendly at the party, you doubted it was anything too nasty.

It&#39;d been a while since you were in grade 4 so memories were hazy. Plus there was the usual trepidation about being with a new group of people. Even if it was a bunch of kids that you were only going to know for a week, it was human nature to be concerned. You&#39;d say that everyone wants to fit in, but you most emphatically did not want to &#39;fit in&#39;. You were going to get through this week and then get back to normal life.

The school wasn&#39;t terribly big so it wasn&#39;t long before you&#39;d gotten to class. Somehow Sophie had already secured you a seat right beside her. 

Sitting down you tried to get your bearings. Grade 4 wasn&#39;t quite as extreme as you&#39;d expected. There were some colourful informational posters on the wall, but that was the only thing that stood out. Otherwise it was fairly similar to your high school classroom. It made sense, they were on the cusp of not being children, they wouldn&#39;t want the room to be silly and kiddy anymore. It was time to become serious students. Or at least that&#39;s what you supposed they felt. From your perspective it was clear that they were still kids. 

We were still kids, you corrected. You didn&#39;t want to join in too much, but you didn&#39;t want to cause a stir. It wouldn&#39;t go well if you started acting like you were so above it all. Looking over to Sophie her sparkling emerald eyes met yours. It seemed she&#39;d been watching you the entire time. She grinned at you, but you just rolled her eyes.

[[Class began|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="752" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 7" tags="" position="225,9475" size="100,100">The entire day you were waiting for the other shoe to drop. Where it would turn out you were an awful student? Or too clumsy to play tag? Or any of a dozen other potential quirks? The suspicion continued over the day but you hadn&#39;t caught anything untoward. Your education had been stripped down to an age appropriate level, but you were still keeping up. You weren&#39;t going to be an exceptional student, but you&#39;d do alright. 

As for being clumsy, if anything it was the opposite. A game of tag at lunch had revealed that Sophie and you were two of the fittest people in the entire grade. Puberty hadn&#39;t really kicked in yet so the boys were on an even playing field with the girls. Though Sophie still seemed to take a special pleasure in catching some of the more arrogant boys. You&#39;d accuse her of being arrogant as well, you&#39;d certainly thought so at the party, but watching her here among her peers had changed your mind. It wasn&#39;t unearned arrogance, it was earned confidence. Certainly she was brash about it, but she was awfully athletic compared to the rest.

Which made it even more odd that you could keep up. At the party the girls had been pushing you towards a more stereotypical little girl, weak and delicate. Now you were even more suspicious. There //had// to be something you were missing.

[[The day continued|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="753" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 8" tags="" position="350,9475" size="100,100">Only at the end of the day were Sophie&#39;s intentions finally revealed. At the final bell you were ready to find Emily and head home, glad to be done the day. Sophie had other ideas.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;No rushing away you,&quot;@@ she grabbed your hand, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;we&#39;ve got practice to go to.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Practice?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Suspicion crept into your voice, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;practice for what exactly?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Gymnastics of course,&quot;@@ she smiled innocently, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;no need to be so suspicious. Now come on, I wanna show you off.&quot;@@

It turned out the gym where Sophie practised wasn&#39;t particularly far away, though she was still scant on details even as you walked.

She dragged you into the changing room despite your protests.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;You&#39;re a girl now, you&#39;re allowed to be in here. Stop being a baby.&quot;@@

Sophie was an indomitable force when she wanted something. She wasn&#39;t about to let something like, &#39;you used to be a sixteen year old boy,&#39; stop her from getting you into a leotard.

[[Get dressed|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 9]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="754" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 9" tags="" position="475,9475" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/SophieHigh/Leotard1.webp&#39; &quot;topRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\
You got lucky on two fronts. First there were stalls available, so you could change without being out in the open. Second, it seemed like you&#39;d come early enough that foot traffic was low. There was one other girl who came in, but you just @@.girlVoice;hid in the stall@@ until she left.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Come on. There&#39;s no one else here. You&#39;re taking forever.&quot;@@

Hesitantly you exited the stall. It wasn&#39;t just the possibility of others that had you nervous, you also weren&#39;t sure about your own garb. In truth it was a very simple one piece leotard with no sleeves. A little pink and black design with a few sequins for visual appeal. You knew it&#39;d come from Sophie&#39;s wardrobe, which only made the whole situation all the more surreal. 

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Are all your leotards pink?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; It was a weak attempt to diffuse your own anxieties. 

She rolled her eyes in response, but then grinned, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;The pink suits you. I&#39;ve got to make you look good for your first day. Anyway,&quot;@@ a gentle flush crept onto her cheeks, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;I like pink.&quot;@@

Another time you would have teased her about this. She always seemed somewhat embarrassed about some of her more &#39;girly&#39; interests and this was a prime opportunity to needle her. However, you also got the feeling she was revealing this just to make you feel better. So you let her off the hook. Meekly giving a, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;thanks,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; as the two of you went back out to the main gym.

[[Time for practice|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="755" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 10" tags="" position="600,9475" size="100,100">Your anxieties only got worse as the two of you got onto the floor. It wasn&#39;t a massive gym, but it was packed with equipment, a large empty space in the center. Sophie would later inform you it was for practising &#39;floor routines&#39;. At this point you didn&#39;t really care about any of the equipment, you felt ridiculous in this leotard. No one was paying you any attention, there was nothing at all odd about appearance from their perspective, but you still felt @@.girlVoice;awkward and exposed@@.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Breathe,&quot;@@ Sophie whispered into your ear, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;I&#39;m the only one who knows anything, you&#39;re fine.&quot;@@ She leaned back and raised her voice, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;now come on, let&#39;s practice.&quot;@@

There was a cough from behind you, @@.coachVoice;&quot;I&#39;ll be the judge of that.&quot;@@

The two of you turned, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;Ah coach. Of course, I meant after you said okay.&quot;@@ You&#39;d learned something new about Sophie, she was a terrible liar.

Coach, you didn&#39;t have an actual name yet, smoothly continued, @@.coachVoice;&quot;Welcome to our gym. Sophie tells me you have some experience. I&#39;ll need to see what you can do before I let you run loose.&quot;@@

She took the two of you to the empty mat, @@.coachVoice;&quot;Let&#39;s see a move or two. Whatever you feel comfortable with.&quot;@@

You didn&#39;t feel comfortable with anything right now. Your previous attempt at gymnastics had been dicey at best. But Sophie seemed entirely comfortable, clasping your shoulder, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;Come on girl. You&#39;ve got this, go for it.&quot;@@

Staring at the expanse of empty space you considered what you should try.

[[Round-off (Easy)|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 11]]
[[Handstand Forward Roll (Easy)|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 11]]
[[Back Handspring (Medium)|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 11]]
[[Front Handspring (Medium)|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 11]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="756" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 11" tags="" position="725,9475" size="100,100">You let out a breath as you cleanly landed the move. Sophie clapped, though the coach was less impressed. You were in shock. How had you just managed a move like that? It wasn&#39;t flawless, but it was a solid attempt and you knew you could do better next time.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Told you it&#39;d be fine. Now try something a little more your level,&quot;@@ Sophie&#39;s voice made it clear that she wanted you to raise your level, not lower it, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;you know all the moves I do after all.&quot;@@

Your eyes widened in surprise, even as the coach looked even less convinced. So //that// was the game. The increased athleticism, the excellent balance, the precise bodily control. This wasn&#39;t the form of some average nine year old, this was the body of nine year old gymnast. Apparently one on par with Sophie, because all of your knowledge had actually come from her. So you literally knew everything she did about gymnastics, and had the skills to execute it.

What ensued was an extremely impressive sequence of moves. It wasn&#39;t a proper floor routine; you were haphazardly chaining moves, and entirely skipping the artistic component, but it was an excellent demonstration of your capabilities. When you finally came to a rest, once again sticking the landing, you could feel the sweat beading on your forehead. Your heart was pounding and you were breathing heavily. But it wasn&#39;t because you were tired. Far from it, @@.girlVoice;you were elated@@, you felt like you could do this for days. 

It was the exhilaration. You&#39;d never felt anything like this. It was one thing to be able to do a pull-up like you used to, but this was something extraordinary. You had practically flown across the mat, twisting and spinning and flipping on a whim. This body was capable of marvels and you @@.girlVoice;loved how it felt@@.

[[The coach clapped|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 12]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="757" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 12" tags="" position="850,9475" size="100,100">@@.coachVoice;&quot;Seems you weren&#39;t exaggerating Sophie, she&#39;s quite impressive. Though she does share some of your bad habits.&quot;@@ Coach fixed Sophie with a mild glare. Later Sophie confided in you that she&#39;d been slacking a little lately and not working on fixing those habits. 

@@.coachVoice;&quot;But clearly experienced enough that I don&#39;t have to be concerned. You have free reign. If you need anything just shout, otherwise I&#39;ll check on you every so often.&quot;@@ With that she walked away, her gaze fixed on a girl doing a terrible job on a balance beam. She wasn&#39;t gripping enough with her toes, that was going to make proper balance impossible.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Come on, let&#39;s have some fun.&quot;@@ She grabbed your hand, breaking you from your private critiques. As she pulled you over to the vault you ruminated on how you&#39;d recognized balance beam girl&#39;s mistake. However, it wasn&#39;t something you could really discuss in public. So for now you followed Sophie&#39;s lead as she practised a variety of flips. Turned out today was just a drop-in free practice session. There were no lessons or schedule to worry about. Which meant the two of you had the run of the place.

You took full advantage of that. Trying to get yourself onto every piece of equipment you could find. Just because you mentally knew how to do the move, didn&#39;t mean you knew how it felt. Knowing the mechanics of an aerial flip was a pale imitation of feeling the wind whipping through your hair. Of feeling the fine control as you twisted your body, all in preparation of a clean landing.

Sophie had been true to her word, you were capable of everything she was. She&#39;d had an edge at first, as you were getting used to the feeling and figuring out your limits. However it wasn&#39;t long until the two of you were pushing each other into moves at the very edge of your abilities. Safely of course, the two of you had been doing this long enough that you weren&#39;t stupid...well Sophie had been doing it and you&#39;d gotten a copy of knowledge. It was weird having knowledge you had no memory of learning, but it was awfully handy.

[[Practice ended|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 13]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="758" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 13" tags="" position="975,9475" size="100,100">By the time practice ended, you were completely wiped, and Sophie was no better. You&#39;d both pushed pretty damn hard today, and you did have some limits. God it was the @@.girlVoice;most fun you&#39;d ever had@@. The ease at which you could do such complex manoeuvres was intoxicating. It made you want to keep pushing further, so that you&#39;d be capable of even more.

The smile didn&#39;t leave either of your faces until you&#39;d left the building. You&#39;d been riding enough of a high that you hadn&#39;t even worried about the change room this time. As if the pure feeling wasn&#39;t enough, Coach had gone out of her way to compliment both of you on your performance. Though Sophie received some gentle admonishment about not working that hard the rest of the time.

Out of earshot Sophie finally revealed the full shape of her plot. @@.sophieVoice;&quot;I wasn&#39;t done beating you,&quot;@@ she confided, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;so I wanted another week to prove I&#39;m better than you. But this time we&#39;d start on even footing.&quot;@@

It took you a few moments to process this. You knew Sophie had enjoyed your little competitions, but you&#39;d never thought she would take it this far. Making you her literal equal was an interesting choice. She could have just as easily requested that you were strictly inferior to her. Make it easy to crush you at everything you tried all week. But no, she&#39;d wanted a rival, someone on her level, at least for the week.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Same time tomorrow?&quot;@@ The hopefulness was obvious in her voice, and you had no intention of declining.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Totally,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you might not like being a little girl, but if you were stuck this way you could at least enjoy it. Plus you @@.girlVoice;couldn&#39;t think of anything more fun@@ than jumping around, barely touching the ground.

[[The next day|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 14]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="759" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 14" tags="" position="1100,9475" size="100,100">The rest of the next day might as well have not existed until the school day was done. You&#39;d spent the entirety of class staring at the clock, watching the seconds painfully tick by, counting down towards your freedom. It was enough that the teacher had even called you out on it. You took the small lecture with an appropriate amount of contrition. It had been a long time since a teacher had talked to you that way, like you were, well, a child. It was more intimidating when they nearly doubled your height.

Still you managed to apologize well enough that you got out of any real trouble. The real nightmare would have been having to stay for detention. You didn&#39;t want to miss any gym time this week. Neither did Sophie. So when the bell rang the two of you were out the door like a shot, racing each other to the gym. The two of you were panting and sweating even before you&#39;d had time to change. Not that it was going to slow either of you down. Another boon of this body was the recovery time. If there had been any soreness you&#39;d acquired yesterday, it was gone now. You&#39;d run yourself ragged and you still felt one hundred percent ready to go. 

And go you did. Now that you were comfortable with this body you were ready to push it to the limit. You even managed one move that Sophie couldn&#39;t replicate as cleanly, much to her chagrin. Afterwards she confronted you on that point.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;How were you able to do that? I thought we knew the same things!&quot;@@ She wasn&#39;t actually angry, despite her tone. But it&#39;d been a long while since someone her age had been able to outperform her.

You didn&#39;t know for sure, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;you&#39;re a little taller than me. Maybe that changes the leverage point?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; At this point you&#39;d stopped being surprised by all the random knowledge you had.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Maybe...and maybe if I...&quot;@@ Sophie looked like she was about to go back in the gym to try again, but you both did need to get home. You would settle it tomorrow.

[[Wednesday|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 15]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="760" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 15" tags="" position="1225,9475" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/SophieHigh/Leotard2.webp&#39; &quot;topRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\
It was clear Sophie had been thinking on the move all night and was ready to practice it until she got it. So that&#39;s what you both did, spending the entire practice session working on that singular move. Working on getting Sophie just a little tighter so she could stick the landing.

Naturally the coach came over to assist, but didn&#39;t stay long. The two of you had the gist of what Sophie needed to do, it was just a matter of practice. In the end she got it almost as cleanly as you, which was enough to satisfy her for the day. Though she had a little surprise for you when you both came in the next day.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Here,&quot;@@ she handed you a leotard you didn&#39;t recognize. You&#39;d been borrowing her stuff all week, and you would normally tease her about having //another// pink leotard, but this one somehow felt different. 

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;What&#39;s this?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; It was a @@.girlVoice;very pretty@@ garment, predominantly pink but white around the collar with silver and gold streaks intertwining across the torso.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;It&#39;s for you. I thought you should have your own, so you weren&#39;t borrowing mine all the time.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Aw, that&#39;s so sweet. But I don&#39;t really...\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; your words trailed off.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;I know,&quot;@@ the melancholy was heavy in her voice, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;still, I hope you like it.&quot;@@

You&#39;d both avoided saying the words that neither of you wanted to say. You didn&#39;t really need your own outfit because you&#39;d only be a girl for a couple more days. This was almost your last practice. Wasn&#39;t like 16 year old male you could suddenly take up the sport and compete.

Still you put on your @@.girlVoice;best smile@@ and slipped into your @@.girlVoice;new leotard@@. It fit perfectly. Maybe it was the sweet gift or maybe it was because you both knew this was coming to an end, but you didn&#39;t feel as competitive today. You were still trying things, but it was more congenial and sedate. That would change on the last day.

[[Final practice|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 16]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="761" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 16" tags="" position="100,9600" size="100,100">@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Alright. Competition time.&quot;@@ Sophie stated bluntly as you left the change room.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;What?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;You&#39;ve had a week to get used to...everything. So now it&#39;s time to put it to the test. Coach will judge which one of us is better.&quot;@@

That dangerous glimmer had re-entered her eyes. The two of you were growing close, but she wasn&#39;t going to hold back anything today. She wanted to beat you. To prove to you that all that &#39;arrogance&#39; you&#39;d accused her of was more than warranted. You felt much the same and were determined to match every bit of her ferocity.

The change had the coach in near shock. You both were a little stiff on the artistic sections, but she&#39;d never seen Sophie be so precise with her movements. Especially when she was going for some pretty complicated moves. 

You were no slouch yourself, matching Sophie move for move. Wincing at every slight mistake. A little stumble on a landing, an insufficient tuck on a flip. There was still so much you wanted to improve, but you had to focus on right now. You were //not// going to let Sophie beat you.

By the time it was done the two of you were genuinely exhausted, sitting on the ground sweating and panting. Youthful recovery or not you were going to feel this tomorrow. Which only left the matter of the results.

[[The results|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 17]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="762" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 17" tags="" position="225,9600" size="100,100">@@.coachVoice;&quot;I just want to say I&#39;m very proud of both of you.

She took a pause, @@.coachVoice;&quot;It was a close thing. At first I thought I&#39;d just eyeball the comparison, but it was tight enough I actually marked it all down. In anything less serious than a professional competition I&#39;d just say you tied.&quot;@@

@@.coachVoice;&quot;However,&quot;@@ Coach met both of your eyes, still fierce despite the fatigue, @@.coachVoice;&quot;neither of you would accept a tie so...by the numbers, the winner is...Sophie. Congratulations.@@

You expected some excitement, some cheering and maybe even some teasing, but you got nothing. She simply nodded in acknowledgement and got to her feet.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;I&#39;m going to head home now. I&#39;m pretty beat,&quot;@@ and with that she was off to the change room, nary a word about her victory.

Coach sighed, @@.coachVoice;&quot;It&#39;s a real shame this is your last day with us. I&#39;ve never seen Sophie that fired up. With the two of you driving each other, no telling how far you could go.&quot;@@

You nodded, but didn&#39;t have too much else to say. Following Sophie&#39;s lead, though too late to catch her, you got yourself changed and headed home as well. Haphazardly throwing your bag onto your bed when you got there, your new leotard half slipping out. You pulled it out and stared at it. Sophie had gotten this just for you, even knowing you wouldn&#39;t wear it more than twice. Just because she was enjoying your competition so much.

Maybe you could...no...that&#39;d be crazy. You set the leotard aside and continued with your evening. Both your mom and Emily noticed your melancholy, though neither pushed on the matter. There was so much going on it was probably best to leave you some space. Not long after you went to bed, mentally and physically exhausted.

[[You dreamt|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 18]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="763" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 18" tags="" position="350,9600" size="100,100">Your dreams that night were pleasant though somewhat surprising. Sophie and you had been at each other&#39;s throats at the party, but now you were the best of friends. You ran back all of the fun times you and Sophie had at the gym these last few days. All the moves you&#39;d managed to do, all the ones you wanted to try. Watching the smile on Sophie&#39;s face when she finally landed that tricky twist. Things that you would never see or do again.

When you woke up your melancholy had only deepened. This would be so much easier if you&#39;d hated the whole experience. But no, you&#39;d enjoyed almost every part of it. Now that you knew Sophie better all that brashness and confidence seemed well earned. You knew how hard she had to work to get where she was, and it made you want to work just as hard. You&#39;d never had something feel so //good// as gymnastics had. You could pour your heart and soul into the competition and not regret a moment. Furthermore, you still couldn&#39;t get over the fact Sophie had beat you yesterday. You weren&#39;t mad, there was no reason to be mad, but it made you want to work even harder to get back at her. The feeling was intoxicating, a powerful drive that motivated you like never before.

You glanced over, seeing that you&#39;d left the leotard beside you all night. In a strange way it was the source of all these divergent feelings, good and bad...but were there even any bad feelings? You looked @@.girlVoice;super cute@@ in it, and it&#39;d been a @@.girlVoice;lot of fun@@. The rest of the girls were supposed to come over today before you turned back. Maybe it was a chance to show it off one more time before you&#39;d have to give it up.

As you held it there was a tingle in your fingers. You assumed it was just your excitement, but it sort of felt like mom&#39;s magic. Regardless you slipped the leotard on, throwing the rest of your clothes over top. It wasn&#39;t the most comfortable thing, but it&#39;d be a fun little surprise. At least that&#39;s what you&#39;d expected to happen. In reality you never even got the chance.

You almost shook your head, you had really wanted the other girls to see what you could do. Your own little gymnastics demonstration, before you got all big and clunky again. But you couldn&#39;t exactly tell your mom that. So you just stared. Which she took as an acknowledgement.

Once again you felt her magic wash over you. Hoping that, at a minimum, your clothes changed with you this time. Shrinking out of an outfit was embarrassing, but not destructive. Growing up would shred your @@.girlVoice;favourite leotard@@. You waited for the changes, closing your eyes so you could try and feel which parts changed and how...you waited...and waited...and waited...

You opened your eyes, confirming what you&#39;d been feeling. You were entirely unchanged. Glancing at mom it seemed this hadn&#39;t been an intentional misdirect on her part. Her look slid from confusion to concern as she took in the situation. Finally her expression changed into one of suspicion. 

@@.momVoice;&quot;Are you wearing something underneath your outfit?&quot;@@ Mom&#39;s voice was cool, but you could tell something was off. It wasn&#39;t like you were embarrassed about your current fashion choices, but how did she know and why did it matter?

You stood, stunned. Leave it to your mother to see the truth of things, even things you weren&#39;t ready to admit to yourself.

She knelt down so you were eye to eye, her intensity was almost overwhelming. The gravity of the situation was obvious.

[[You nodded|Sophie Low Happiness Ending 22]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="767" name="Sophie Low Happiness Ending 22" tags="" position="850,9600" size="100,100">You closed the door to the bathroom behind you, stripping off the rest of your clothes, leaving you clad only in your @@.girlVoice;leotard@@. Mom was right, it suited you. Not only did you like how it looked, but you liked how it made you feel. 

It wasn&#39;t just the garment itself, but all the feelings it engendered in you. It made you feel strong and confident. The strength was far more than physical. Your sixteen year old self had been an order of magnitude stronger, but bigger muscles had never made you actually feel good about yourself. All that time in the gym had just been rote, putting in no serious effort. There was no joy in it, it was just something you were &#39;supposed to do&#39;.

Now you had something that you @@.girlVoice;loved@@. Something would happily work at every day. Every success lifting you higher and every failure making you want to work harder. Your success would be in your own hands, down to your own drive and determination. You had all the tools to excel. You were equal to Sophie in every way. No more need for jealousy, you had all she did, if you wished to take it. 

[[Leave it on|Sophie Low Happiness Leave On 1]]
[[Take it off|Sophie Low Happiness Take Off 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="768" name="Sophie Low Happiness Take Off 1" tags="" position="975,9600" size="100,100">As much as you had loved your time in this form, it didn&#39;t truly feel like you. You were supposed to be older, you&#39;d been on this planet to long to go back to being nine. You had a newfound respect for Sophie abilities, but your feelings weren&#39;t competitive. Seeing her improve would be a sight to behold, but you weren&#39;t going to be her rival.

You returned from the bathroom with the leotard in hand rather than under your clothes. 

Mom gave a subtle nod, @@.momVoice;&quot;Put it down over there, otherwise it will cause trouble.&quot;@@

You had zero idea of how a leotard could cause any issue when it came to powerful magic, but she was the expert, so you put it on the couch. You awaited a second casting of the spell.

[[The magic washed over you|Sophie Low Happiness Take Off 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="769" name="Sophie Low Happiness Take Off 2" tags="" position="1100,9600" size="100,100">This time when the magic hit you, you could feel the changes. A sense of vertigo dizzying you as you shot back up, inches at a time. Luckily your outfit did seem to be keeping up.  It was a girl&#39;s outfit, but you didn&#39;t want to be naked, and Emily would kill you if you tore one of her outfits. 

Your limbs quickly followed suit, though there was a funny moment when you&#39;d been stuck with far too short arms on a quickly lengthening torso. A torso that was also gaining some of it&#39;s mass back. You&#39;d been strong as a nine year old, but it didn&#39;t compare to the real muscles you&#39;d earned in the gym. It was a little unfair in truth, that guys were able to build muscle so much easier, but it was a discussion for another day.

You were almost back to full size now, but a few crucial details hadn&#39;t changed yet. For one you were still basically hairless, save for the still too long hair tickling your neck. Still, it was only a matter of time, the changes were slowing down so that would all come in shortly. Which it did, kinda. You could see hairs on your arms and legs, but they were extremely fine, barely visible at a distance.

You huffed in frustration. What was going on? Dimly becoming aware that your dramatic sigh had caused some uncharacteristic bouncing. You&#39;d felt the mass coming back to your chest and ass, and had assumed it was just muscle. Now that you stared at it you were increasingly unsure. The mounds of flesh on your chest were well past what anyone could call pecs, and they were still growing.

[[The changes finished|Sophie Low Happiness Take Off 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="770" name="Sophie Low Happiness Take Off 3" tags="" position="1225,9600" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt;\

As the changes slowed to a stop you were still several inches shorter than you&#39;d been originally. However, diminished height was not the thing that currently held your gaze. That honor was held by the two breasts, there was no other word for them, hanging off your chest.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Mom?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Your words trailed off, demanding an explanation in their absence.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Interesting. Yet you don&#39;t seem upset.&quot;@@ 

To your surprise you had to admit she was right, you&#39;d been shocked by the unexpected form, but it didn&#39;t feel unpleasant.

She took on a lecturing tone, @@.momVoice;&quot;Soul magic is complex, but in short; you accepted a gift befitting your other form. Not only accepted, but used it, loved it, truly making it yours.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Well sweetie,&quot;@@ her voice was concerningly sweet, @@.momVoice;&quot;looks like you&#39;ll be spending a little longer as a girl.&quot;@@

The feeling in your heart was complicated. You&#39;d wanted to get back to who you were, but you&#39;d also wanted to keep playing with Sophie, that conflict had left you in this half state.

The ensuing discussion revealed that, at least for the moment, there was nothing to be done. Next week you&#39;d go back to high school and resume normal life until further notice. A simple charm would make everyone accept that you were a girl. A simple hitch in the mind before declaring &#39;of course she&#39;s always been a girl&#39;. The human mind was lazy, easier to believe that memory was faulty than that a boy suddenly turned into a girl.

Your protests were half hearted at best, going through the motions of objecting. Yet your heart wasn&#39;t in it, part you was glad she wasn&#39;t going to turn you back. Perhaps she&#39;d figure something else out eventually.

[[Back to school|Sophie Low Happiness Take Off 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="771" name="Sophie Low Happiness Take Off 4" tags="" position="100,9725" size="100,100">It was remarkable how quickly you fell back into your normal routines. School really wasn&#39;t all that different than before. Sure you hung with the girls rather than the boys, but half the time the conversations were the same. Speaking of boys, they //really// needed to be more discreet about where they were staring. You definitely had no interest in exploring that side of your, now more mature, femininity. The idea of holding a boy&#39;s hand, let alone kissing one was gross. You didn&#39;t need stubble scratching your face.

Though your current chromosomal makeup did allow for one activity you&#39;d been bereft of before. Sophie&#39;s gymnastics gym was still open to you. It wasn&#39;t that men weren&#39;t allowed in there, but they were a drastic minority, and none past the age of ten. Seemed that gymnastics was still relegated to being a &#39;girly&#39; activity. You didn&#39;t feel that way, there was a grace and elegance to it, but it also required a massive amount of physical strength and endurance. Something that this body had been blessed with.

It seemed that you were the sixteen year old version of your previous gymnast self, one who had continued training. So you were in fantastic physical condition. Your skills were little better than they&#39;d been at nine, so you were lightyears behind when it came to competition, but good enough to not stand out.

Sophie wasn&#39;t sure how to feel about it at first. Your increased physical attributes meant you were able to outdo her at basically everything, at least for the moment. However, she was mollified by the fact you more than half a decade on her and all that knowledge had come from her anyway.

To make it up to her, you made her an offer. You weren&#39;t ever going to be in competition shape, it would take too long for your skills to catch up. But you knew enough to be able to help her with her own training. Since you wanted to spend time in the gym anyway you were willing dedicate a some time to just helping her. 

An assistance that quickly branched out into other girls. Nothing official, but a pointer here or a correction. Coach noticed, and you were worried you might be kicked out. Instead you&#39;d been taken on as an &#39;assistant coach&#39;, and were spending basically every night at the gym.

[[Weeks passed|Sophie Low Happiness Take Off 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="772" name="Sophie Low Happiness Take Off 5" tags="" position="225,9725" size="100,100">Initially you checked in every day with mom, if she&#39;d figured out a way to make you a man again. It was to be expected. After continued rejections you started to ask only every few days, then once a week, once a month...after a while you couldn&#39;t even remember the last time you&#39;d asked. 

You&#39;d had a growing suspicion that there was no way back, but it was matched by a growing indifference to the idea. Between school and coaching you had too much on your mind to care. Being a girl wasn&#39;t all that different, and you enjoyed most of the changes that had come with it.  Every thirty days or so you reconsidered that position, but on the whole you loved who you were.

Coaching had given you a sense of purpose that you&#39;d lacked previously. That new drive manifested itself in myriad ways. Your marks improved, you made new friends, you even got along better with your sister. A sister who had taken a while to warm to the idea of a &#39;big sister&#39;. It was certainly an improvement on &#39;big brother&#39;, but she&#39;d still liked the idea of &#39;baby sister&#39;. Nonetheless she came around to it, especially once she realized your coaching prowess could help her with ballet as well.

At this point the idea of ever going back to being a boy had completely left your head. You&#39;d have to give up too much to ever want to make the swap, you were going to stay as &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; forever. And to think, if Coach hadn&#39;t guilted you about leaving, none of it might have happened. For want of a nail you supposed, but you didn&#39;t have time for philosophizing. Sophie had a competition coming up, and if you didn&#39;t kick her butt she&#39;d get lazy again. You sighed, a coach&#39;s work is never done. But you still smiled, after all, you couldn&#39;t think of anything you&#39;d rather do.

The implications of this decision were dramatic, but you were still stuck on the fact you really wanted to show it off to the girls. Perhaps it wasn&#39;t the best reason to start a whole new life, but it felt right in the moment.

Without saying anything your mother knew you decision, giving you a gentle smile before casting another spell. The tingles raced across your body, stronger than before. However, it still seemed that nothing was happening to your body, though it felt like your leotard was getting hotter by the moment. Perhaps wearing so many layers in summer wasn&#39;t a good idea, but this wasn&#39;t a normal heat. It built to the point that you were worried it was going to melt into you. 

Finally the heat abated and you were able to take a steadying breath. 

@@.momVoice;&quot;How are you feeling?&quot;@@

It was a normal question to which you had a shockingly normal answer, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Great. I feel great.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Your mother nodded, @@.momVoice;&quot;I doubt you understood the metaphysical implications of accepting a gift like that, but in the end...&quot;@@ she paused, realizing that this conversation was going over your head.

Mom seemed like she had more to say, but was staying quiet for the moment. @@.momVoice;&quot;Well your friends will be here soon, try not to cause too much trouble.&quot;@@

With that you hurried off to prepare for girl&#39;s arrival. The day itself was a @@.girlVoice;ton of fun@@. Just as you desired you got to show off your @@.girlVoice;new leotard@@. Jumping around the yard and showing all the new moves you were capable of. 

Sophie and you put on quite a display for the others. Though Kara insisted on putting a stop to it when it was clear you were both trying some risky moves not meant to be done on grass. She was right of course, but it&#39;d been easy to get caught up in things.

Since it wasn&#39;t a school night they were all able to stay over for dinner and even pretty late into the evening. By the time bed time came you were completely exhausted by all the fun you&#39;d had. Collapsing onto your sheets before you&#39;d even fully undressed, sleeping in your new @@.girlVoice;favorite garment@@.

Once again your dreams were filled with the joys of the week, but this time you felt much less conflicted. They were just fun, there was no reason to hesitate about that, you could just enjoy yourself. When you finally awoke it felt like a burden had been lifted, you felt better than you ever had before, and you&#39;d felt great this week.

Still something else was different, but you couldn&#39;t quite place it. Either way you headed down to breakfast with a spring in your step.

[[Breakfast|Sophie Low Happiness Leave On 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="775" name="Sophie Low Happiness Leave On 4" tags="" position="600,9725" size="100,100">@@.emilyVoice;&quot;You know you can&#39;t wear that leotard all the time, right?&quot;@@ Emily had come down before you and was almost done her own meal.

You flushed, you were still wearing your leotard, and you&#39;d been wearing it all night. It was just so comfortable, it didn&#39;t feel like you were wearing anything, like it was a part of you.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Oh she can wear what she wants,&quot;@@ mom countered.

There was a flutter of happiness in your stomach. At her permission you wore it for the remainder of the day. Taking moments when you could do play around in the yard. Despite knowing it was silly, you even slept in it again. 

Which made it more surprising when you woke up the next morning and it was gone. You panicked, tearing apart your room looking for it. You threw on a robe and hurried downstairs where mom was drinking her morning coffee.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Mom!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You took a breath to calm down, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;my leotard is gone!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You were struck with a sudden thought, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;did you take it to wash it?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; 

You tried your best to keep the accusatory tone out of your voice, but it was a somewhat dramatic suggestion. She would have had to strip you overnight for that to happen.

@@.momVoice;&quot;No need to panic sweetie, you still have it. In a manner of speaking.&quot;@@

//Why is she always so cryptic?//

@@.momVoice;&quot;It&#39;s part of you now. Although I suppose that isn&#39;t going to work for actual practice.&quot;@@

A gift accepted with your whole heart is a powerful thing. It would ward off any magic that tried to change you.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;But I&#39;m not wearing it anymore, it&#39;s gone,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; a fact you were still upset about.

Mom set down her coffee and fixed you with an amused stare, @@.momVoice;&quot;I think you understand exactly what happened.&quot;@@

You wanted to say you had no idea, but the knowledge had been lurking in the back of your mind. Obviously you couldn&#39;t really wear your leotard all the time, if nothing else you&#39;d need to wash it. If it came off, the magic would weaken, over time it might weaken enough that you could even be turned into a boy again. So mom had made it possible to wear it all the time. 

Not in the physical world of course, but in your mind. Your self image could be of a nine year old in a leotard and whatever you wore in reality wouldn&#39;t change that. It had become a fundamental part of you, which meant that no one would //ever// be able to turn you back.

You gave a wide smile to mom. It&#39;d been exactly as she promised, you&#39;d be able to stay this way forever. You just hadn&#39;t realized how important that leotard had been to the whole process. 

she smiled back, @@.momVoice;&quot;it will take a little time but I&#39;ll get things set up so it&#39;s official. For now just say you&#39;re staying in town a few more weeks.&quot;@@ She didn&#39;t mention all the paperwork that she&#39;d need to do, or the fact she&#39;d also need to ensorcell a few people. You didn&#39;t need all the gory details, you were just a little girl, that was an adult concern. 

As celebratory gift she waved her hand and summoned a copy of the leotard. To the eye it was identical, but instinctively you could tell that it was just a copy. Still, it was the best you were going to do now that the original was literally inside you. 

[[Back to school|Sophie Low Happiness Leave On 7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="777" name="Sophie Low Happiness Leave On 7" tags="" position="850,9725" size="100,100">Your day back at school was quite enjoyable. It was fun progressively shocking every one of the girls. Your classmates just thought it was nice you could stay longer, but the group knew better. Emily was the first to get the shock when mom revealed you were going to walk to school together. Sophie was next, watching her eyes goggle out when you walked into the room was a joy. It was all you could do to not burst out laughing then and there, but you restrained yourself until lunch. Which was when you got to bring Kara and Miki up to speed. Both of them were excited, Miki moreso, but she was always the more excitable one.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;You&#39;re really staying this way?&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Yup.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Your voice was light, but it was clear that Sophie was conflicted. She felt guilty about the situation, thinking she got stuck in this form. Except you didn&#39;t think of it as &#39;stuck&#39; at all. You threw your arms around her, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;don&#39;t look so sad. I promise I&#39;ll let you win sometimes.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

The coach was excited to see you back even if, at first, it was supposed to be for just a few weeks. Now with endless time to practice you and Sophie renewed your training regimen. Anyone who thought you&#39;d drop your level was proven dead wrong. As hard as you&#39;d both trained last week for your single competition, now you had the long view to consider. It wasn&#39;t about beating Sophie at the end of the week, it was about beating Sophie every week, for months and even years.

So the two of you spent all the time you could in the gym. Though you both knew better than to neglect your studies. You actually managed to get some pretty good marks, though more from sheer bloodymindedness than raw intelligence. That intensive work ethic meant you could succeed at anything you tried, as long you had time to work at it. Emily sometimes complained that you never spent any time with her, but she still much preferred it to the old you.

This competitive nature didn&#39;t abate as the two of you grew older, even at the beginning of high school you were both still clashing at every competition. This rivalry having driven you both to higher heights. You were already considered stars at the local level, but buzz about you was starting to make it&#39;s way into the wider world. 

So your paths were set. You were both gunning for college scholarships in gymnastics. Though this still meant education was important, as much as it sometimes bored you. Luckily you always had the two of each other to fall back on, helping each other with academics as much as gymnastics.

Sophie always stayed a little taller, and you grudgingly admitted, a little stronger. While you stayed slighter. Though of the two of you, you were the one who had been &#39;blessed&#39; with the bigger chest, much to Sophie&#39;s chagrin. Though she got her vengeance when you had to deal with the discomfort of constricting sports bras.

Naturally your fit figures cut a rather appealing look, bolstered by the fact you&#39;d both become co-captains of the cheerleading squad. Neither of you took cheer too seriously, but it was still good practice, and looked good on an entrance application. This combination of factors meant that you drew //a lot// of attention from horny teenage boys. 

In fact, you got even more attention than Sophie. She claimed it was because you, in her words, had &#39;cow tits&#39;. A term that annoyed you to no end, even more when she emphasized the point by grabbing them from behind. Initially you&#39;d said it was because she was too scary, but she claimed that none of the boys were her type. Though at the time only the two of you knew how true her statement was.

Much to the frustration of the legion of boys, neither of you ever even gave them the time of day. The claim was that you needed to focus on competition, especially the one that was coming up soon.

[[The competition|Sophie Low Happiness Leave On 10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="780" name="Sophie Low Happiness Leave On 10" tags="" position="1225,9725" size="100,100">@@.sophieVoice;&quot;You ready?&quot;@@ Sophie was doing final checks on her outfit, nervously tugging at it to make it sit perfectly. It was cute seeing her so flustered when she was normally so brash, but you understood. Rumour had it there was going to be a scout in the audience, coming to see if all the buzz about the two of you was justified. It was still a bit of a pipe dream but this might even be the first step towards competing in the Olympics. But that was a dream for another day, today you just had to keep focused on the competition.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Ready to kick your butt. As always,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you gently teased. The two of you usually traded victories back and forth, the loser inevitably training even harder so it didn&#39;t happen again.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Deal,&quot;@@ and the two of you sealed the pact, as you always did now, with a good luck kiss. Just a peck mind you, you didn&#39;t want to draw too much attention. Everyone knew about the two of you, but you still liked to keep things mostly low key. Unlike Sophie...

This was not the first time this conversation had occurred. The boys at school were relentless in trying to get with you or Sophie, endlessly hinting at things and suggesting that &#39;certain rumors&#39; would stop if you just got with a boy. Rumors you knew were actually spread by the girls as much as the boys. Teenagers were often cruel for no particular reason.

You tried not to let it bother you too much, but made you wonder if things would be easier if you just made your relationship public. Then again the fact the relationship was with //Sophie// might cause even more hassle than just staying quiet.

It wasn&#39;t a secret from the &#39;sleepover crew&#39; of course, in fact Emily was the first one you&#39;d confided in. To your delight she was entirely supportive, though miffed that she owed Miki $20. Apparently Miki had seen this coming long before anyone else, well before you and Sophie had even realized it. That girl wasn&#39;t the best at school in general, but she had an almost supernatural sense when it came to matchmaking.

Not long after both your parents had been let in on the secret. Much like Emily, your mom entirely supported it. There was some concern about Sophie&#39;s parents, they were rather more traditional, but they loved their daughter and came around to the idea almost immediately.

Telling the general school population was another matter entirely. Which is why you were sitting through the latest lecture/teasing session about your being single.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Sophie what are-\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you sputtered, a premonition building about her intentions.

Your words were cut off by Sophie leaning down and kissing you full on the lips. Holding the kiss long enough that there could be no doubt this was no prank. This was a declaration.

She broke the kiss, looking down at your shocked face with her annoyingly smug one...it made you want to kiss her again. This was hardly the first time you&#39;d kissed, but never had it been so public. The rest of the table was stunned for a moment before a near riot broke out. The teachers actually had to step in to get everyone to calm down. You knew that story would make it&#39;s way around the entire school before the lunch hour was even over.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Sophie. A word.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You grumbled at her, pulling her out of the lunch room into a semi secluded hallway.

You fixed her with a glare, hands on your hips, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;did you think you should have maybe run that by me first?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You were annoyed that she&#39;d made such an important move without consulting you, but also relieved that it was finally out.

Sophie just grinned at you, fully aware that your annoyance had no teeth behind it. You rolled your eyes, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;come here you,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you grabbed the front of her shirt, pulling her into another kiss. No doubt someone would spot your little tryst, but you almost wanted them to. Dispel any remaining notions that either of you had an interest in boys...

[[You broke the kiss|Sophie Low Happiness Leave On 13]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="783" name="Sophie Low Happiness Leave On 13" tags="" position="350,9850" size="100,100">You broke the kiss, smiling back at the memory of Sophie&#39;s wild proclamation. It had caused a stir for a few days, mostly sour grapes from boys who felt they had been denied some chance they never had in the first place. Some nasty rumours had been spread, but they didn&#39;t last long. For one both you and Sophie could kick the ass of most of the school population, including the boys. Second, Emily confided in you later that she&#39;d &#39;discussed&#39; the matter with one of the boys saying the nastiest things, and that he wouldn&#39;t be an issue anymore.

You never did find out the exact contents of that &#39;discussion&#39;. But considering the lecture Emily had received about &#39;reckless use of magic&#39;, you doubted it had just been a formal debate. Though even seeing the lecture it was pretty clear your mom&#39;s heart wasn&#39;t in it. Mom probably actually supported Emily&#39;s &#39;debate tactics&#39;, but didn&#39;t want to set the precedent.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to that dinner.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You purred.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;You wish.&quot;@@ Sophie retorted.

You both smiled before putting on your serious faces. This was the most important competition of your lives, and a step into the big time. It was terrifying, and Sophie clearly felt the same. She quickly grabbed your hand and gave it a squeeze. You nodded and then headed out. It was scary, but you couldn&#39;t imagine having anyone else at your side. Your eternal rival and perhaps, someday, something even more.

Emily whispered something to Kara and Kara spread the news to the other two. Within moments all four of them were near ecstatic, though they kept giving you odd furtive looks.

Mom let you in on the secret, @@.momVoice;&quot;the girls had so much fun this weekend that we&#39;re going to have another sleepover next weekend.&quot;@@ 

//Well that explains their excitement.//

@@.momVoice;&quot;But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be around this time so you don&#39;t have to worry about taking care of them.&quot;@@

You winced at your mother&#39;s words. This was supposed to be a positive, and it would have been for the you at the start of the party, but you were a different person. Now you wanted to join the fun again, even if it was as the babysitter.

@@.momVoice;&quot;And since you were a good sport about everything, you&#39;ve been invited to come as well.&quot;@@ 

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Huh?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Mom had said she would already be the babysitter, so how exactly had you been invited? &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt;= 13&gt;&gt;As much as you wanted to play, you didn&#39;t really want to go through the whole regression thing again. If nothing else you didn&#39;t want to spend half the time worrying that your outfit might fall off.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; You weren&#39;t really in their age group, unless they planned on trying to rectify that again.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Your mother noted your confusion, no doubt she&#39;d expected it. As a way of explanation she handed you a small necklace. @@.momVoice;&quot;Put it on, it will make things clearer.&quot;@@

[[Put on the necklace|Golden Ending 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="785" name="Golden Ending 4" tags="" position="600,9850" size="100,100">As you slipped the necklace on, you could feel the faint tingle of an static charge. The pleasant static quickly spread to your entire body. It felt oddly familiar.

Mom started getting taller, wait no, that wasn&#39;t right. You were getting shorter, //a lot// shorter and it was happening in a hurry. You watched as the hard won muscles in your arms and legs shrank away into nothing. Leaving behind smooth arms that seemed like they couldn&#39;t lift a feather; and hairless legs that seemed so thin you were shocked you could still stand. Your hands and feet followed suit with their attached limbs. Shrinking down into @@.girlVoice;soft, delicate@@ little things that felt awkward to use.

The rest of the muscles in your body followed suit. Gone were your pecs, replaced instead with a small undefined chest. Gone were your abs instead a @@.girlVoice;a cute little tummy@@ that had just a bit of pudge on it. Your well toned glutes? Gone. Leaving behind an entirely flat @@.girlVoice;bum@@. All the hard work you&#39;d done as you became a man, gone.

Though perhaps being concerned about your &#39;manliness&#39; wasn&#39;t a big deal when you weren&#39;t even &#39;male&#39; anymore. Long blonde hair tickled your narrow shoulders as you tried to grapple with what had happened. Mom simply smiled mildly and waited for the inevitable questions.

What the hell was going on? You sounded like a little girl...probably because you were. It was really quite obvious, but you did have the excuse of losing &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &gt;= 7&gt;&gt;almost &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;a decade of your mind the last minute.

Your mother gave a small laugh, @@.momVoice;&quot;I thought that would be fairly obvious. If you&#39;re going to join the sleepover next weekend you&#39;ll need to look the part. It wouldn&#39;t do to have a sixteen year old boy playing with a bunch of little girls, now would it?&quot;@@ She held up a small mirror so you could see yourself.

The noise you made was somewhere between a gasp and a @@.girlVoice;squeal@@. The expression on the @@.girlVoice;angelic@@ little girl that looked back at you matched the gasp. The face had only a few hints of the old you, but it was undoubtedly you. Well, a $playerAge year old girl version of you. Standing there wearing nothing but a t-shirt so big it&#39;d become a dress.

&lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &gt; 10&gt;&gt;\
	This was much younger than you&#39;d ever been regressed to during the party. It made sense, you wouldn&#39;t really have fit in properly at your old age. It seemed that Emily had finally gotten her wish for her to be the @@.girlVoice;big sister@@. 
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	You been regressed back to exactly the same age as you&#39;d been when you went to bed last night. &lt;&lt;if $traitCatgirl&gt;&gt;Complete with cat tail and ears.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerMaturity &gt; 10&gt;&gt;\
	Your mind felt hazy and slow, with sudden large gaps in knowledge. It had been regressed much further than you&#39;d experienced at the party. Likely putting you in line with the other girls. Though you still had all of your acquired quirks.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	Your mind felt hazy, but familiar. This was the same brain you&#39;d ended up with at the sleepover, complete with all your acquired quirks.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

@@.momVoice;&quot;Don&#39;t worry, take off the necklace and you go back to normal. A gift to you for taking such good care of the girls.&quot;@@

You looked back in the mirror and your sister&#39;s grinning face. The party had been pretty fun. Freed from the burden of babysitting and the looming threat of regression it&#39;d be even more fun.

A wide smile crept onto your face, showing off your @@.girlVoice;missing teeth@@, and you nodded. 

Emily cheered and grabbed your hand, dragging you off towards her room. @@.emilyVoice;&quot;Come on, you can take off the necklace later. Let&#39;s play first.&quot;@@ 

Your smile only got wider. The party had been so much fun, and now you could go back into that form whenever you wanted. Considering the way the both of you were smiling, you doubted this would be the last time.

[[Finish the party|Golden Ending 7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="788" name="Golden Ending 7" tags="" position="975,9850" size="100,100">There wasn&#39;t much time left before the girls had to go home but you all intended to make the most of it. Now that mom was here you didn&#39;t have to worry about the girls getting into trouble. In fact you weren&#39;t above starting a little trouble of your own. It was equal parts embarrassing and amusing listening to your mother admonish you about being careful when you&#39;d taken things a @@.girlVoice;little too far@@. Even she had to laugh after she finished the lecture. Since you were that @@.girlVoice;small@@ she&#39;d fallen into the same patterns as she did when lecturing Emily. But it did work, and for the last hour you did you best to behave...@@.girlVoice;mostly@@.

But all good things must come to an end and waving goodbye to the girls felt rather sad. A day ago you&#39;d been dreading the idea of spending a few hours with them and now you didn&#39;t want to see them leave. They hadn&#39;t been the biggest fans of you either. It had only been a day, but things had changed quite a lot. Maybe seeing you regressing and playing with them had changed their opinions on you. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt;= 9&gt;&gt;Being forced to look them in the eye, or @@.girlVoice;look up@@ to them in the case of Sophie, had certainly changed yours.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Though just because they were gone didn&#39;t mean that the fun was over. After all your sister was more than happy to keep the party going, just the two of you. Without a &#39;smelly big brother&#39; to deal with, she didn&#39;t need to hold back on her more exuberant tendencies. You weren&#39;t sure if you were supposed to be offended at being called smelly. Technically you weren&#39;t even a big brother right now, so you filed that one away for later consideration and counter teasing.

Naturally, now that you were basically her size, she couldn&#39;t resist the urge to try and dress you up. Her closet was huge, so there was no time for everything, but if it was @@.girlVoice;cute@@, or @@.girlVoice;girly@@, or @@.girlVoice;pink@@, she wanted to see you in it. Even you had to admit they were improvements over the @@.girlVoice;oversized t-shirt@@ you&#39;d been running around in, as @@.girlVoice;cute@@ as it had been.

[[Bed time|Golden Ending 8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="789" name="Golden Ending 8" tags="" position="1100,9850" size="100,100">@@.girlVoice;Mommy@@ put an end to the fun. Bed time was nigh and both of you had school in the morning, though neither of you were looking forward to it. Still, it wasn&#39;t like @@.girlVoice;mommy@@ was taking the necklace away, that was the whole point after all. You&#39;d have it and be able to use it whenever you wanted, even if @@.girlVoice;mommy@@ or Emily wasn&#39;t around. That was something you hadn&#39;t fully considered. Right now it was something you&#39;d use to play with the other girls, but technically you could just use it on your own. There wasn&#39;t a compelling reason why you would do so, but the possibility did exist.

A possibility you rapidly found yourself indulging in. After a particularly onerous week at high school, @@.girlVoice;relaxing and having some fun@@ with Emily seemed like just the thing the doctor ordered...the witch ordered? You weren&#39;t the only one who saw the potential advantages in the situation. Admittance was cheap for kids @@.girlVoice;under twelve@@. The movies, the zoo, museums, there were discounts as far as the eye could see. &lt;&lt;if $traitCatgirl&gt;&gt;You were even @@.girlVoice;cute enough@@ that no one questioned the fact you had ears and a tail. Everyone just assumed it was an @@.girlVoice;adorable@@ costume.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Meals were also cheaper, since you didn&#39;t need to eat as much. Though you didn&#39;t understand the mechanics of calorie counting when you kept changing size.

Of course you attended more sleepovers, initially only when they were at your house to keep explanations to a minimum. But once the other girls had let your name slip enough times, no one questioned it when you went over there as well. Eventually mom had to put a limit on the number of them, otherwise she would have to host one every other weekend.

[[You thought back on all the adventures you&#39;d had|Golden Ending Vignettes]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="790" name="Golden Ending 9" tags="" position="1225,9850" size="100,100">Everything went on fine for a while, swapping back and forth nearly at a whim and living this pseudo-double life. Sure you didn&#39;t go to school as a @@.girlVoice;little girl@@ but you spent whole days that way, you even met some of Emily&#39;s classmates. The necklace was always on your person, only taking it off to shower. It wasn&#39;t that you needed to transform all the time, but the swapping felt like it was a part of you.

This ignorant bliss didn&#39;t last forever. At first it was just a few minor points, having to rush to finish homework you&#39;d forgotten, not hanging out with your high school acquaintances, a general lack of focus on your future. It was damaging your performance at high school life, and it was getting worse. As a result, when you were a @@.girlVoice;little girl@@ you found yourself more and more anxious about what you were neglecting. Concerns about the time you were &#39;wasting&#39; preventing you from really @@.girlVoice;having fun@@ with the girls. 

Everything came to a head, at least in your mind, near the end of a boring Tuesday. You were sitting in a rather boring History class, not particularly paying attention to the lesson. You&#39;d already gotten a small lecture about forgotten homework, which had demotivated you even more. Instead of taking notes you&#39;d been doodling little flowers in the margins. At that moment you realized that you didn&#39;t want to be here, you didn&#39;t want to do any of this boring teenage stuff anymore.

Gritting your teeth you pushed the way through the rest of the day before rushing home. You sat on your bed, amulet in hand, and considered the situation. Living two separate lives wasn&#39;t going to work, at least not like it was going. Whenever life got too hard or too boring, there was too much temptation to retreat into your @@.girlVoice;little pink happy go lucky world@@. That wasn&#39;t dealing with life, that was escaping it, sure it wasn&#39;t drugs or drink, but it still didn&#39;t seem healthy.

[[What to do...|Golden Ending 10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="791" name="Golden Ending 10" tags="" position="100,9975" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if $oldGirlName === &quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;set $tempGirlName to $oldGirlName&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
You turned the amulet over and over in your hand. It wasn&#39;t that you&#39;d have to stop using it entirely, it&#39;d just have to become an intentional occasional diversion. Making sure that your &#39;real&#39; life was handled before you logged off and focused on @@.girlVoice;unicorns and coloring books@@.

But if it wasn&#39;t an escape? What if that was just your life? What if you spent //all// of your time as @@.girlVoice;$tempGirlName@@? &lt;&lt;if $oldGirlName === &quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;A name Emily had decided upon one day, and felt @@.girlVoice;too right@@ to say no.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; If you stayed as @@.girlVoice;$tempGirlName@@ you wouldn&#39;t be escaping anything. It would just be your life. Every day could be @@.girlVoice;unicorns and coloring@@ and you wouldn&#39;t be ignoring other &#39;more important&#39; things.

The more you thought on it the more the idea loomed large in your mind. It had all started at the sleepover, all the fun you&#39;d had, the friends you&#39;d made. How natural it felt to act more and more like a little girl. It made you feel like the rest of your life might have been a mistake, that //this// is what you were meant to be. The intervening months had only driven that idea home. You felt better as a @@.girlVoice;little girl@@ than you ever had as a teenage boy.

Regardless you were going to have to make a choice, you couldn&#39;t let things keep going this way. It would end up ruining both worlds if the cracks continued to deeper. Did you want to prioritize the world you&#39;d lived in until now? Or trade it out for one that you loved?

[[Keep your old life|Golden Ending Stay Old 1]]
[[Start a new one|Golden Ending Stay Young 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="792" name="Golden Ending Stay Old 1" tags="" position="225,9975" size="100,100">You stood up from your bed, gripping the amulet hard, walking over and dropping it into one of the drawers of your desk. It was still there, you knew where it was, but it was out of sight and hopefully out of mind. You&#39;d get it when you had occasion to, but it wouldn&#39;t be the first thing you reached for.

Mom understood when you explained your decision to her. She&#39;d actually planned on bringing up something similar. Though she had to admit that she&#39;d been enjoying herself as well, brushing some concerns under the rug.

Emily was somewhat disappointed, she also had been having fun with her new sister. But, now that the two of you had grown a little closer, she didn&#39;t mind as much. Having an older brother did come with advantages, and now that you were acting like a good one, she actually liked enjoyed it. 

You did still have the amulet though over time you used it less and less. Mom had the idea to make it a kind of an heirloom. If you had children, they might, on occasion, benefit from a change in perspective. You joked that some of your classmates could use that same perspective shift. Mom smiled but said it wouldn&#39;t work on anyone who wasn&#39;t in the family. But that was a question to deal with far in the future.

Still, you could always use it to unwind from time to time. There was nothing more relaxing then spending an afternoon with a good @@.girlVoice;coloring book@@, letting the @@.girlVoice;big kids@@ deal with the rest of the problems of the world.

Meanwhile you had an entire gaggle of friends ready and waiting in your @@.girlVoice;younger pinker life@@. Which just left the question of how exactly you were going to make it happen? Could you just ask mom directly? What if you transformed yourself and then &#39;lost&#39; the amulet? Was staying this way even possible?

You knocked on the door of the only person who would understand you, and know enough to maybe help you.

You smiled, this sort of thing was a large part of why you wanted to make this change. Who didn&#39;t love @@.girlVoice;dress up@@?

Emily took your smile as confirmation and ushered you in. You&#39;d intended to have this conversation in your teenage form, but now that you were in here it felt awkward. You instead used the necklace to make yourself $playerAge again.

You watched as Emily rifled through her closet for something to put you in. The two of you had tried on basically everything in there, but that didn&#39;t make it less fun.

You were @@.girlVoice;wiggling@@ into your second outfit before you worked up the courage to start really talking.

In the pause you could see the conflict in Emily&#39;s eyes. You could see the litany of snarky comebacks whirring through her mind. Before the party she would have unleashed on you, but now she was more worried about your feelings, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;What is it &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;? Did you want to borrow a dress?&quot;@@

Borrow a dress? You never would have come to ask that. Unless she actually had worked out what was coming and was trying to give you an easy segue into it. 

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;No I...I mean I could, but I was wondering if you knew if it was possible to...\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you let your words trail off, this was harder than you&#39;d expected. How were you supposed to admit to your &#39;little&#39; sister that you wanted to stay $playerAge?

Emily smiled, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;Keep talking, I&#39;ll find the perfect dress for you.&quot;@@

Despite her instruction you still didn&#39;t know what to say, instead staying quiet until she pulled out the @@.girlVoice;cutest dress you&#39;d ever seen@@. She saw your eyes widen at the sight of it, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;I knew you would like this one.&quot;@@ 

Before you could protest she&#39;d already pushed it into your hands. @@.emilyVoice;&quot;Try it on, try it on!&quot;@@

You&#39;d never seen this dress before, had Emily just gotten it? It even sounded like she&#39;d gotten it specifically for you...but why would she do that? It&#39;s not like you&#39;d needed your own clothes.

[[Try on the dress|Golden Ending Stay Young 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="795" name="Golden Ending Stay Young 3" tags="" position="600,9975" size="100,100">Emily was right, the dress was @@.girlVoice;perfect@@. Not only did it look @@.girlVoice;cute@@, but it fit you perfectly. Magic made sure that everything from Emily&#39;s closet mostly fit, but this fit was entirely natural.

She squealed in excitement at seeing you in it which made you @@.girlVoice;blush@@ in response. You still couldn&#39;t get used to the reactions of people gushing over how @@.girlVoice;cute you were@@. It always felt nice to hear, but it was a new experience.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Thanks Emily, it&#39;s super cute, you have great taste.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You still weren&#39;t quite sure how to handle this. Had Emily actually bought this for you? It looked expensive...and why now?

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Anything for my favourite sister!&quot;@@ She giggled, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;let&#39;s go show mommy!&quot;@@ She offered you her hand. You took it, as you so often had lately.

[[Emily joined the hug|Golden Ending Stay Young 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="797" name="Golden Ending Stay Young 5" tags="" position="850,9975" size="100,100">You all stayed like that for a while before mom insisted that it was time for bed. You both had school in the morning. The stress of the day meant that you feel asleep instantly. But your dreams that night were @@.girlVoice;light and airy@@. You&#39;d never dreamt much in the past, but now you dreamt of all sorts of fantastical things. @@.girlVoice;Unicorns and princesses@@. @@.girlVoice;Pet dragons and talking cats@@. When you felt yourself being dragged back into reality you resisted, wanting to stay in that @@.girlVoice;magical world@@.

When you did finally open your eyes you were greeted with something almost as @@.girlVoice;fantastical@@. It seemed that mom had been doing some serious redecorating overnight. Your room was indistinguishable from the one you&#39;d gone to bed in. It was the kind of room that other girls would kill to have. You had an honest to goodness @@.girlVoice;princess bed@@, with @@.girlVoice;lacy pink curtains@@ and everything. Your closet was slightly ajar and you could see all manner of @@.girlVoice;dresses and skirts and blouses@@ just waiting for you. Surrounding you on the bed were a dizzying array of @@.girlVoice;stuffed animals@@, with more scattered around the room. Your walls were covered in @@.girlVoice;butterflies and stars@@.

In another lifetime you would have been disgusted by how over the top @@.girlVoice;pink and girly@@ the room was. You were a different person now. The only thing wrong with the room was that it was so perfect you might never want to leave. However, your excitement for your first day overwhelmed even that, hurriedly throwing on your @@.girlVoice;new favourite dress@@ and running downstairs.

[[Your first day|Golden Ending Stay Young 6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="798" name="Golden Ending Stay Young 6" tags="" position="975,9975" size="100,100">It turned out that mom really had handled everything to make sure your new life as a little girl started off smoothly. There were just a few little tweaks required. Not every trait you&#39;d picked up at the sleepover was appropriate for real life.

&lt;&lt;if $traitCatgirl&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;set $traitCatgirl to false&gt;&gt;\
	Your @@.girlVoice;cute@@ ears and tail were gone. You were a little disappointed, but it was necessary. You couldn&#39;t play them off as a @@.girlVoice;charming@@ costume when you were actually going to school....it&#39;d be way too many questions.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $playerAge !== $playerMaturity&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;set $playerMaturity to $playerAge&gt;&gt;\
	There was a small change to your mind. A small disharmony had been created between your physical and mental ages, which was bound to cause some distress. Now you had a normal $playerMaturity year old mind to go with your $playerAge year old body.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $traitGRatedLanguage&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;set $traitGRatedLanguage to false&gt;&gt;\
	She&#39;d removed your mental compulsion that&#39;d left you unable to say @@.girlVoice;bad words@@. You still wouldn&#39;t say them of course, but now it was because you wanted to be a @@.girlVoice;good girl@@ and not that you &#39;&#39;had&#39;&#39; to be a @@.girlVoice;good girl@@.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $traitBornToLose&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;set $traitBornToLose to false&gt;&gt;\
	You didn&#39;t know it but Emily had actually received quite a talking to about the curse she&#39;d laid upon you. The one that had ensured you could never win at any game, no matter how hard you tried. She wasn&#39;t supposed to be using magic like that, and mom had removed it before it interfered with your life.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $traitHonest&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;set $traitHonest to false&gt;&gt;\
	She was tempted to leave you with your compulsion to be honest, but decided against it. Yes she wanted you to always be honest with her, but it had to be your choice, otherwise it was meaningless.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $traitHypnoSillyLittleGirl || $traitHypnoPrettyPrincess || $traitHypnoComplimentCurtsy&gt;&gt;\
	She also saw fit to remove the post-hypnotic triggers that the girls had left in you, though they weren&#39;t really necessary anymore. &lt;&lt;if $traitHypnoPrettyPrincess&gt;&gt;Like every girl you still @@.girlVoice;wanted to be a princess@@. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $traitHypnoComplimentCurtsy&gt;&gt;You loved how it felt to @@.girlVoice;curtsy@@, you felt so @@.girlVoice;pretty@@ and @@.girlVoice;elegant@@. &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $traitHypnoSillyLittleGirl&gt;&gt;Plus you were only $playerAge years old, so you were a @@.girlVoice;silly little girl@@ by default.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

	&lt;&lt;set $traitHypnoComplimentCurtsy to false&gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt;/silently&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
Satisfied with her work there was one last change to make. She touched the necklace you still wore around your neck. There was the sound of a chime, a single pure note. Though it felt like it was coming from inside of you.

@@.momVoice;&quot;There,&quot;@@ mom gave a gentle smile, @@.momVoice;&quot;now it&#39;s just a pretty necklace for a pretty little girl.&quot;@@

Your eyes went wide in excitement. It was one last confirmation that this was your life now, that the wondrous choice you&#39;d made would last forever.

Mom pulled you in for a hug and you realized that, though she was trying to hide it, she was crying. @@.momVoice;&quot;I&#39;m so glad you found who you were.&quot;@@ When you were older she would explain to you about the reason for the sleepover, the curse, the trial, everything. But today was special and she didn&#39;t want to do anything to mar it, it could wait.

The rest of the morning was a blur. You were so @@.girlVoice;hyper@@ that you would have forgotten your own head if it wasn&#39;t attached. Finally mom had gotten you properly dressed and prepared. Backpack packed, lunch made and ready to go. Emily of course walked you to school, the two of you endlessly ramping up each others excitement. Such was your level of emotion that even a nominally boring school day was a joy to you. No doubt the time would come where the sheen would wear off, but for now you&#39;d do school seven days a week if you had to.

[[The days went on|Golden Ending Stay Young 7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="799" name="Golden Ending Stay Young 7" tags="" position="1100,9975" size="100,100">The other girls were equally excited by the sudden turn of events. Emily had spoken to them about the possibility, she&#39;d had a hunch about you, but they hadn&#39;t known you&#39;d actually make the switch. Within minutes of the reveal plans had been formed for yet another sleepover, one properly welcoming you permanently into the group.

This one mom was more than willing to host. It was a @@.girlVoice;a ton of fun@@. Half way through the day, you realized it was a near duplicate of that first sleepover. Though this time you didn&#39;t need any alterations to your mind or body to fit in. So when you were all in Emily&#39;s room for the latest dress up session you had no objection to @@.girlVoice;trying on everything@@ that was suggested. The final results were so exciting that you had to call mom in to get a picture.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Scoot in Sophie. You&#39;re part of this too.&quot;@@

Sophie grimaced, but moved in closer, making sure her lovely green dress was sitting properly. The rest of you quietly tittered at her. She was putting on a front, pretending that she was so above all this silly dressing up. But you all knew better, she was just as happy to be @@.girlVoice;dressed up as a princess@@ as the rest of you were. Either through magic or clever planning there was a dress prepared for each of you, in the right size and of your favourite @@.grilVoice;Disney Princess@@.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Now everyone say cheese!&quot;@@

Mom snapped the picture of the five @@.girlVoice;adorable little princesses@@, smiling wide without a care in the world, no matter how many teeth they were missing. You were right there in the middle, your sister on one side and Miki on the other. No one would ever guess that a few months ago you&#39;d been a teenage boy who disdained the rest of them. To think one sleepover had started you down the path to looking and acting like you did now. Made over from a miserable mean teenage boy into a @@.girlVoice;cute little girl who couldn&#39;t be happier@@.

You were unsure. There was excitement but there was also trepidation. You&#39;d never done ballet before, and now you were facing a whole class.

Emily assured you that she would be there the whole time. Her class took place an hour after yours, so mom had dropped the two of you off together. Though apparently your class, &#39;Twinkle Toes&#39;, wasn&#39;t technically a proper ballet class, but &#39;pre-ballet&#39;.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I dunno...\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You were also feeling a little self concious. You&#39;d never worn something quite this @@.girlVoice;girly@@ and considering your experiences that said a lot.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;I told you, all the other girls will be dressed like that. This is just Twinkle Toes, it&#39;s for fun.&quot;@@ Emily pressed on undaunted.

This didn&#39;t entirely remedy your feelings. Esepcially considering the difference in your and Emily&#39;s wardrobe.

[[Look at your outfits|Vignette Ballet Class Young 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="802" name="Vignette Ballet Class Young 2" tags="" position="225,10100" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;balletImageColumn&quot;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;Image &quot;Endings/GoldenEnding/Ballet/BalletShoesYoung.webp&quot;&gt;&gt;\
&lt;/div&gt;\
Emily was in what you might call a fairly &#39;classic&#39; ballet outfit. A pink leotard with a modest skirt, white tights and cream colored shoes, even her hair was back in a bun. She looked so @@.girlVoice;pretty@@ and @@.girlVoice;elegant@@, but it was almost understated. It was a practice outfit, it wouldn&#39;t have the flourishes of a recital dress.

On the other hand your outfit made most recital dresses look bland. You also had a @@.girlVoice;pink leotard@@, except yours had @@.girlVoice;sequins@@ spelling out &quot;Ballet&quot; on the front. Complete with a set of @@.girlVoice;shiny ballet shoes@@ and a @@.girlVoice;little bow@@ to tie them off. Instead of a normal skirt you had a proper @@.girlVoice;tutu@@. A bunch of @@.girlVoice;light ruffled layers@@ that @@.girlVoice;poofed@@ out all around you. Your tights matched, but in contrast to Emily&#39;s no nonsense set, yours had an @@.girlVoice;embroidered ballerina@@ around your ankle. The shoes continued the trend, pink, and came with an extra @@.girlVoice;pink pom pom@@ by the toe. Mom had even painted your nails @@.girlVoice;pink@@ to match.

Everything about it was @@.girlVoice;pink@@ and @@.girlVoice;girly@@. This outfit, and by the extension the class, wasn&#39;t about practicing ballet, it was about making you feel like @@.girlVoice;ballerinas@@. Heck, even your bag had a tutu of it&#39;s own. Emily and your mom had gone all in on this one. If you were going to try ballet for the first time then they wanted to make sure you enjoyed it. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 8&gt;&gt;You @@.girlVoice;loved it@@, even if it was a bit much. You kind of wanted to be in a class with Emily, but you were only $playerAge years old, so you were slotted into pre-ballet.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You @@.girlVoice;couldn&#39;t be more excited@@, you got to be a @@.girlVoice;ballerina!!!@@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

[[Ready for class|Vignette Ballet Class Young 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="803" name="Vignette Ballet Class Young 3" tags="" position="350,10100" size="100,100">It turned out that &#39;Twinkle Toes&#39; wasn&#39;t actually the youngest class they hosted. When you arrived there were still a few @@.girlVoice;adorable@@ toddlers bouncing around the room.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;This isn&#39;t really a ballet class,&quot;@@ Emily explained, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;they&#39;re just having fun.&quot;@@

The truth of Emily&#39;s words were obvious. There was no consistency to the outfits on display. Some were in full regalia like you, some had the tutu but no tights, and a couple were actually dressed much like Emily. You were a little embarrassed that there were @@.girlVoice;toddlers@@ who were dressed more grown up than you.

Emily saw your discomfort, whispering to you, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;I think they&#39;re cuter in their tutus, don&#39;t you?&quot;@@ 

You did. Much @@.girlVoice;cuter@@. They were basically babies, no need to take things so seriously. Then again, the same outlook seemed to apply to your class as well, and you weren&#39;t a baby.

[[Time to start|Vignette Ballet Class Young 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="804" name="Vignette Ballet Class Young 4" tags="" position="475,10100" size="100,100">The &#39;Tiny Tots&#39; class came to an end, the toddlers all moving through a final &#39;synchronized&#39; sequence. It was a complete mess, some were even facing the wrong way in the end, but they were still @@.girlVoice;just so cute@@. Plus you&#39;d never dare tease them, considering you might be in the same situation in a few minutes.

So you, and the rest of the &#39;Twinkle Toes&#39; class, stepped onto the floor. Emily was right there supporting you, but you were still nervous. Unlike with the toddler class there seemed to be two very distinct groups when it came to dress. There were a few girls in more formal training gear, while you and the others were in full regalia. This class went from ages 4-6 and most of those in @@.girlVoice;tutus@@ were in the 4-5 group, with the 6 years tending more mature. This only made you more nervous, it seemed like the older girls had at least some experience, while you were a complete newbie. You almost wished you were @@.girlVoice;younger@@ so there were less expectations.

@@.teacherVoice;&quot;Alright girls, gather round,&quot;@@ spoke a tall @@.girlVoice;beautiful@@ woman. She was in an all black outfit, likely to make her easily visible and exuded a calm pleasantness that did wonders to soothe you.

@@.teacherVoice;&quot;We have a new girl joining us today as a trial, why don&#39;t you say hello &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;?&quot;@@

You took back your commentary about being soothed, with everyone&#39;s eyes on you things had only gotten worse.

[[Introduce yourself|Vignette Ballet Class Young 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="805" name="Vignette Ballet Class Young 5" tags="" position="600,10100" size="100,100">You were being silly, you knew that. It was just a bunch of @@.girlVoice;little girls@@ like you. But it was a new activity, with new people, in a new place and it had all become terribly overwhelming.

Nervously you fiddled with your @@.girlVoice;tutu@@, terribly self concious about how @@.girlVoice;childish@@ it was. &lt;&lt;if $traitChubby&gt;&gt;You were also keenly aware of how tightly it fit you. All the other girls were super skinny, while your stomach was obvious to anyone with eyes. Normally you could come to terms with that, but right now it was just another thing that weighed on your mind.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $traitSoftspoken&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;span class=&quot;smallText&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Hi, I&#39;m &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; you squeaked out. Though no one else could really hear you.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Hello, I&#39;m &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you did your best to keep your voice steady despite your nervousness.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

You needn&#39;t have worried, most of the other girls were overjoyed to have a new girl in their midsts&lt;&lt;if $traitSoftspoken&gt;&gt;, even if they hadn&#39;t heard your name&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;. Some of the &#39;serious&#39; girls seemed annoyed about your inexperience, worrying it would slow down the whole class, but the rest were just having fun. They @@.girlVoice;loved@@ your outfit, and you @@.girlVoice;loved theirs@@ and everyone was just having a good time prancing around pretending to be @@.girlVoice;ballerinas@@.

&lt;&lt;if $traitClumsy&gt;&gt;\
	You were however, terrible at it, even by the standards of this group. You could keep up with the four year olds, but the rest were so much more @@.girlVoice;graceful@@ than you. It should have been mortifying, being so @@.girlVoice;clumsy@@, but you were having too much fun and everyone else was just so supportive. Maybe you shouldn&#39;t have been mentally teasing the toddlers for stumbling around, considering you were doing much the same. But even when you did trip it just made everyone, including you, @@.girlVoice;giggle uncontrollably@@.

&lt;&lt;elseif $traitCatgirl&gt;&gt;\
	You were actually a little more clumsy than you would have expected considering you were a @@.girlVoice;catgirl@@. Not that anyone else knew that. Mom had given you a little charm to hide that fact, keeping your ears and tails under wraps. Though if someone paid enough attention they might notice something odd about your eyes. However, you found yourself constantly off balance. Turned out your tail was more important than you&#39;d realized.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
At first the teacher was trying to keep the class somewhat calm, and focusing on the teachings of the day, but that was abandoned. If a gaggle of kindergarteners were having @@.girlVoice;too much fun@@ to focus there wasn&#39;t much to do but roll with it. So it became a light fun lesson to show the new girl the &#39;joys of ballet&#39;.

[[Class continued|Vignette Ballet Class Young 6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="806" name="Vignette Ballet Class Young 6" tags="" position="725,10100" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if $traitSlowLearner&gt;&gt;Despite the light tone there were still enough instructions to make your head spin. It was fine, you just followed along with the other girls and didn&#39;t worry if you were a step behind the entire time.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You weren&#39;t sure how much you&#39;d actually learn from today&#39;s class, but it was @@.girlVoice;lots of fun@@.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Even after class was done you and your new friends were chatting about how you //had// to come again next time. &lt;&lt;if $traitChatterbox&gt;&gt;You&#39;d actually been @@.girlVoice;chatty@@ for the entire class, which the teacher had to keep gently admonishing you for. But you couldn&#39;t help yourself, there was just @@.girlVoice;so much to talk about@@.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; So you talked with each of them until their @@.girlVoice;mommies@@ came to pick them up. It&#39;d been so easy to just fall into these @@.girlVoice;silly, giggly@@ conversations about nothing at all. &lt;&lt;if $traitFashionista&gt;&gt;Though you&#39;d never consider any conversation about different @@.girlVoice;tutu choices@@ to be unimportant.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Finally when you were the last one left the teacher came over to you. @@.teacherVoice;&quot;Now, if you can keep quiet you can watch the next class. Can you do that for me?&quot;@@

You nodded. Despite the fact you basically hadn&#39;t been silent since you&#39;d arrived, you did really want to see Emily dance. So you covered your mouth to show the seriousness of resolve. Sitting down as Emily and the other girls prepared for their class.

[[Watch Emily&#39;s class|Vignette Ballet Class Young 7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="807" name="Vignette Ballet Class Young 7" tags="" position="850,10100" size="100,100">Watching the girls in Emily&#39;s class you were struck by the difference in tone. They were only a few years older than you, but they seemed so @@.girlVoice;mature@@ and @@.girlVoice;refined@@. Gone were the @@.girlVoice;frilly tutus@@ and ornately patterned leotards. Simple leotards, cream tights and modest shoes. Some of the girls didn&#39;t have a skirt at all.

Your @@.girlVoice;awe@@ only increased as the class started. Even in practice they all moved in sync, the precision of their movements stunned you. Your class hadn&#39;t been a ballet class, it was just prancing around, this was real ballet, and none were older than ten. How @@.girlVoice;amazing@@ would a teenager be?

It was simple to keep your promise to be silent as you sat there with rapt attention. You would have sooner stopped breathing than make any sound that might interrupt their @@.girlVoice;beautiful dancing@@.

When their class finally did finish you ran up to Emily, looking up at her with @@.girlVoice;undisguised awe@@. &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Can you teach me to do that?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Which part?&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;All of it,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you said gravely.

[[Emily laughed|Vignette Ballet Class Young 8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="808" name="Vignette Ballet Class Young 8" tags="" position="975,10100" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &quot;Endings/GoldenEnding/Ballet/BalletBagYoung.webp&quot; &quot;smallTopRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\
@@.emilyVoice;&quot;That might take a bit sis,&quot; she tousled your hair, &quot;but if you practice hard maybe you&#39;ll even catch up to me.&quot;@@

The two of you smiled at each other, aglow in sisterly affection. The two of you grabbed your bags, though yours was better, chatting while you waited for mom.

When mom did finally come you up, the two of you were basically attached at the hip. Even when you got home, Emily spent the rest of the evening teaching you more of the basics. You talked about class and what else you could learn and when the recitals were.

It was only at the end of the night that you came back down to Earth. Emily had to go to bed and you still had high school homework to do. You&#39;d both been so excited that you&#39;d forgotten that this state of affairs was only a temporary thing. With the day over you had to go back to @@.girlVoice;boring school@@ where you couldn&#39;t @@.girlVoice;wear a tutu@@ at all. It sucked, you wanted to do more ballet...

[[Other memories|Golden Ending Vignettes][$balletVignetteViewed to true]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="809" name="Vignette Ballet Class Old 1" tags="" position="1100,10100" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &quot;Endings/GoldenEnding/Ballet/BalletShoesOld.webp&quot; &quot;smallTopRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Are you sure these are right?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You made another attempt at trying to correctly tie your ballet shoes.

You&#39;d seen ballet shoes with a simple strap, and those wouldn&#39;t be a problem. However, Emily had insisted that the ribbon would secure your foot much better. The fact they were so much @@.girlVoice;prettier@@ was supposedly just a side benefit.

However you were stuck with a mess of ribbons that currently secured nothing at all.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Mmmhmmm, they work much better. Don&#39;t you trust your sister?&quot;@@

//Right now? Not really.//

You made another attempt at the ribbons only to end up with a knot you were struggling to get undone. Growling you sat back and glared at your sister. From the beginning she&#39;d said that she&#39;d help you do them up, you&#39;d refused, and now you were stuck admitting your struggles. Rolling your eyes you stuck out your foot, accepting your defeat.

Emily giggled and came over to help, tying them up in two swift movements that made it seem like it should have been trivial to do. Apparently this particular skill hadn&#39;t come along with the rest of mom&#39;s little &#39;ballet boost&#39;.

[[Before class|Vignette Ballet Class Old 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="810" name="Vignette Ballet Class Old 2" tags="" position="1225,10100" size="100,100">Since you were $playerAge years old there was a certain expectation of your skill level. The school had a &#39;pre-ballet&#39;, but it was meant for kindergartens. They apparently didn&#39;t offer &#39;basics&#39; to anyone else. There were other schools of course, but you&#39;d wanted to attend ballet with Emily, not at some different place across town. So mom had given you a little &#39;leg up&#39;, taking a copy of Emily&#39;s ballet skills and superimposing it upon you. It made you, generally, about as skilled as her. Though it seemed some ancillary skills like tying up your shoes hadn&#39;t made the jump.

Emily had one major reservation about this strategy, that it was totally unfair. She&#39;d worked for years to get this good and you just got it with a snap of a finger? However, her mother had managed to talk her down from the position. &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &gt;= 9&gt;&gt;Firstly, despite the fact you were older, you were no better than her. Mom couldn&#39;t make a copy of skills Emily hadn&#39;t yet acquired.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Firstly, she still deserved full credit for your abilities. Without her you wouldn&#39;t be able to do much.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Secondly, if you wanted to keep those skills for more than a couple days you would have to start training your butt off. Ingraining this shallow imitation would be no trivial task. Third, as you&#39;d noticed with the shoes, you didn&#39;t know //everything// Emily did, so she still got her chance to play mentor for her &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &lt;= 8&gt;&gt;little&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;big&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; sister.

&lt;/div&gt;
With your shoes finally done up it was time to actually step onto the floor for your &#39;first&#39; ballet lesson, though no one would ever believe that fact considering how skill you&#39;d be. Or at least you hoped you&#39;d be good. &lt;&lt;if $traitClumsy&gt;&gt;Despite the knowledge you&#39;d been given it didn&#39;t change the fact you were a total @@.girlVoice;klutz@@&lt;&lt;elseif $playerAge &lt;= 7&gt;&gt;Since you were younger than Emily you were a little less coordinated.&lt;&lt;elseif $playerAge &gt;= 9&gt;&gt;You were actually a little older than Emily, but you weren&#39;t sure how much that would actually help.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Though you did have to wait until the @@.girlVoice;Twinkle Toes@@ class was done. This was the &#39;pre-ballet&#39; class for a bunch of @@.girlVoice;adorable@@ little girls who&#39;d never done it before. The oldest was no more than six and most of them were dressed up in the @@.girlVoice;frilliest pinkest@@ ballet outfits you&#39;d ever seen. Your uniform was somewhat more sedate. You were dressed up for ballet, they were dressed up as @@.girlVoice;ballerinas@@. 

Which wasn&#39;t to say you didn&#39;t @@.girlVoice;love your outfit@@. It was @@.girlVoice;pink@@ and it had a @@.girlVoice;cute flowy@@ skirt that was //almost// a tutu without looking too immature. Your tights were a simple solid white, which others might think was boring, but you knew better. They weren&#39;t just tights, they were @@.girlVoice;&#39;&#39;ballet tights&#39;&#39;@@ which meant you were a @@.girlVoice;ballerina@@, even if you weren&#39;t as overt as the younger ones. &lt;&lt;if $traitFashionista&gt;&gt;You knew of course that this outfit was much more @@.girlVoice;fashionable@@ and @@.girlVoice;mature@@, but you really did @@.girlVoice;want to try on@@ one of those over the top ones eventually.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Come on sis, time to go.&quot;@@ Emily offered you a hand.

You took it and stepped onto the floor. &lt;&lt;if $traitDaydreamer&gt;&gt;Emily looked almost surprised at your level of sharpness. This was the kind of situation where you usually @@.girlVoice;drifted off@@ into some @@.girlVoice;daydream@@ or another. But there was no need for dreaming right now, this was a @@.girlVoice;dream come true@@.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

[[Class begins|Vignette Ballet Class Old 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="812" name="Vignette Ballet Class Old 4" tags="" position="225,10225" size="100,100">As class began you couldn&#39;t help but be a little self concious. Sure you looked exactly like a $playerAge year old girl, and there was no way anyone could know better, but it still gnawed at you. &lt;&lt;if $traitChubby&gt;&gt;It didn&#39;t help that the body you had //did// stand out in one way. All the other girls were so @@.girlVoice;pretty@@ and @@.girlVoice;thin@@, while you had an obvious @@.girlVoice;tummy@@. You couldn&#39;t hide anything in a leotard. You didn&#39;t think it would impede your abilities much, but you already felt awkward.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

@@.teacherVoice;&quot;Alright girls, gather round,&quot;@@ spoke a tall @@.girlVoice;beautiful@@ woman. She was in an all black outfit, likely to make her easily visible.

@@.teacherVoice;&quot;We have a new girl joining us today as a trial, why don&#39;t you say hello &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;?&quot;@@

The rest of the class turned to you, redoubling any uneasy feelings. But your sister was right there, casting you a comforting glance.

&lt;&lt;if $traitSoftspoken&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;span class=&quot;smallText&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Hi, I&#39;m &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; you squeaked out. Even with your sister&#39;s comfort you did have trouble raising your voice.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Hello, I&#39;m &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you did your best to keep your voice steady despite your nervousness.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

There was an odd diversity of reactions among the other girls. Some of them were just excited to have someone else join them, but others seemed more ambivalent about your presence. Though you had no opportunity to get close to them before lessons began.

[[Follow along|Vignette Ballet Class Old 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="813" name="Vignette Ballet Class Old 5" tags="" position="350,10225" size="100,100">What ensued were a series of stretches and poses that, until today, would have been completely alien to you. &#39;Plie&#39;, &#39;Port de bras&#39;, &#39;Adagio&#39;, and another dozen terms that sounded new to your ear, yet your body knew what to do. Which was good because some of the poses seemed //insane// at first blush. Trying to get your leg that high in the sixteen year old version of you would be both impossible and dislocate your hip in the attempt. Yet now it felt natural. You even had to bend down lower, leaving your leg on the bar in order to get a proper stretch. Clearly mom had given you some of Emily&#39;s physical prowess as well, because you doubted your average $playerAge year old could just naturally do this.

But it felt so good. To be able to move your body this way. To bend and twist in ways that were almost @@.girlVoice;dreamlike@@. The experience was @@.girlVoice;magical@@. Despite your obvious experience making it seem like you&#39;d done this hundreds of times, you were getting to feel it all for the first time. It was @@.girlVoice;intoxicating@@ and you understood why Emily loved it so much. It wasn&#39;t just that it @@.girlVoice;looked pretty@@, though it did, it was also how it made you feel.

As the class progressed the other girls quickly warmed to you. It seemed the few with reservations were concerned that you had no experience at all, and were going to mess up their class. Now that you&#39;d shown your prowess they all welcomed you with open arms. Though you had to admit, despite how much fun it was, it was a lot harder than you&#39;d experienced. You had a newfound respect for the amount of effort Emily had put in. You&#39;d thought of her as impatient and flaky, assuming ballet must have been easy to actually hold her attention. Apparently she had more perseverance than you&#39;d realized.

[[Class ended|Vignette Ballet Class Old 6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="814" name="Vignette Ballet Class Old 6" tags="" position="475,10225" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &quot;Endings/GoldenEnding/Ballet/BalletBagOld.webp&quot; &quot;smallTopRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\
As class ended you were fatigued but satisfied. Rubbing your feet as you switched back into your outdoor shoes. In the end you weren&#39;t sure if Emily had been telling the truth about the shoes being &#39;better&#39;, but you hardly cared. You&#39;d gotten to be a @@.girlVoice;ballerina@@, that was worth a little discomfort.

You sat with your sister as you and the other girls waited for your parents to arrive for pick-up. Naturally you all chatted as you did, a flurry of names for you to remember. Emily&#39;s knowledge of ballet hadn&#39;t come with knowledge of her classmates, though it probably would have been suspicious if it did.

&lt;&lt;if $bubblyTitle&gt;&gt;\
But you loved getting to know them all, they all felt like kindred spirits to you. Your entire group was @@.girlVoice;giggling@@ and @@.girlVoice;gossiping@@ the entire time until your mom finally arrived. The teacher actually had to tell you all to quiet down so you didn&#39;t interrupt the next class.

In fact they weren&#39;t ready to let you go even when all your parents had arrived,

@@.playerVoice5;&quot;Oh you can&#39;t go!&quot;@@ @@.playerVoice7;&quot;You have to come with us.&quot;@@ @@.playerVoice6;&quot;We&#39;re going to the mall.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;if $traitShopaholic&gt;&gt;That was more than enough to convince you. You @@.girlVoice;loved the mall@@.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You were having @@.girlVoice;so much fun@@, you didn&#39;t want it to stop.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You gave your best @@.girlVoice;puppy dog eyes@@ to your mom, something you had gotten remarkably adept at.

[[Mom agreed|Vignette Ballet Class Old 7 Bubbly]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
When mom finally did arrive you wished the other girls a farewell, giving them a vague answer in regards to your return. In truth you weren&#39;t sure, you wanted to do this again, of that there was no doubt, but the situation was complicated. If you came back again and again it would raise other questions, ones you didn&#39;t have good answers to.

So despite the joy you had experienced there was a tinge of melancholy as you rode home. You actually felt a little jealous of Emily, that she was able to have this fun all the time. Maybe you could at least come back another couple times, surely that would be fine...

You understood why Emily got along with these girls, they were just like her. All @@.girlVoice;hyper@@ and @@.girlVoice;girly@@ and @@.girlVoice;giggly@@. Which is to say they were @@.girlVoice;just like you@@.

What ensued was a day that was @@.girlVoice;boundless fun@@ for you and exhausting for the parents that had volunteered to chaperone you all. A bunch of @@.girlVoice;gradeschool girls@@ running around as if any time waiting was time wasted. There wasn&#39;t a single moment of silence.

So you all @@.girlVoice;talked@@ and @@.girlVoice;laughed@@ and @@.girlVoice;shopped@@ for //hours//.

A sixteen year old boy excitedly buying a unicorn covered pink dress in size $playerAge, tended to raise some eyebrows.

You had so much fun that you crashed the moment you got into the car. Waking up in your bed with no recollection of how you&#39;d got there, something Emily found very amusing. That you&#39;d been so @@.girlVoice;overeager@@ that you&#39;d literally collapsed the moment you sat down.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;So you had fun then?&quot;@@ Emily asked, obviously knowing the answer. You couldn&#39;t imagine having more fun than that, and your body clearly couldn&#39;t take it either. Now you just had to find a way to make sure you&#39;d be able to do it again...

It was one thing to see the crowds and costumes on a screen, another to have it all laid out before. It was something entirely different to experience it at &lt;&lt;print $heightArray[$playerAge - $traitShort + $traitTall]&gt;&gt;. Looking down at people dressed as monsters and demons made it cute, looking &#39;&#39;up&#39;&#39; was rather more intimidating.

@@.karaMomVoice;&quot;You alright sweetie?&quot;@@ Kara&#39;s mom looked down at you. 

She&#39;d agreed to be the chaperone for this little adventure which meant, at least for today, you had to do what she said. Plus she wasn&#39;t entirely up to speed on the situation, thinking you were just one of Emily&#39;s cousins. So you had to play a proper $playerAge year old girl. Not that you weren&#39;t more than used to that by now.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;She&#39;s fine. Just excited right?&quot;@@ Kara interjected.

Your other companion on today&#39;s journey was always a welcome sight. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 8&gt;&gt;You had to admit she was more mature than you, and you looked to her for guidance.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You might be a little more mature than her, but she was always a source of calm.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; So it wasn&#39;t a problem that today she was the only one to turn to. 

Emily and Sophie had declared it &#39;not their thing&#39;, which was code for &#39;too nerdy&#39; and Miki had other family engagements. Which meant it was just you and Kara for today, with an entire con before you there was no time to sitting around, time to go.

[[Enter the con|Vignette Anime Convention 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="817" name="Vignette Anime Convention 2" tags="" position="850,10225" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;Endings/GoldenEnding/SailorFuku.webp&#39; &quot;smallTopRightCorner&quot;&gt;&gt;\

Which, of course he did, how in the world would he ever recognize you when you looked like &#39;&#39;this&#39;&#39;?

With that little heart attack out of the way you were able to relax.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Are you ready?&quot;@@ Sophie asked as you stepped out onto the floor.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I think so,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; but you couldn&#39;t keep the hesitation out of your voice. This situation was new to you and there were a lot of things to get used to all at once.

&lt;&lt;if $selfConciousClothingCount &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;\
At least your @@.girlVoice;leotard was cute@@. You&#39;d spent plenty of time as a girl, in all sorts of outfits, so you&#39;d gotten used to more &#39;revealing&#39; clothes. As a male there would be no circumstance in which showing this much leg would be socially acceptable. But in this form, in this room, there was nothing unusual about it at all.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
The first one being your current outfit. You&#39;d spent plenty of time as a girl, in all sorts of outfits, but rarely anything with this much skin exposed. As a male there would be no circumstance in which showing this much leg would be socially acceptable. But in this form, in this room, there was nothing unusual about it at all.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Well, &#39;room&#39;, wasn&#39;t the right term. This was a gym, though it wasn&#39;t like any gym you&#39;d ever worked out in. Instead of weights and machines, it was vaults and rings. There was so much equipment around, and you didn&#39;t have much idea of how to use any of it.

After your little gymnastics competition at the sleepover you&#39;d been curious about gymnastics in general. What Sophie was capable of when she wasn&#39;t just in a backyard? You&#39;d thought you could go see her compete or something like that. Instead you were standing on the floor with her, barefoot and in your @@.girlVoice;own leotard@@. &lt;&lt;if $traitRapunzelHair&gt;&gt;Even your hair was pulled back into a ponytail. Your normally voluminous hair having been reduced to a more manageable level for the day.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;It&#39;ll be fine,&quot;@@ Sophie did her best job to encourage you...to middling effect. Sophie had a brash confidence that you could never hope to match, so you had your own anxieties about the situation.

[[Warm up|Vignette Gymnastics 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="819" name="Vignette Gymnastics 2" tags="" position="1100,10225" size="100,100">It became immediately clear how out of your depth you were, even during stretches. Since you were a &lt;&lt;convertNumberToText $playerAge&gt;&gt; year old girl, you were fairly flexible by default. You could touch your toes and all that, but Sophie was on a whole other level. She was currently on the floor bending her leg backwards all the way back to her head. This was followed up by a standing exercise where she was able to stand on one leg and hold the other leg straight up...not even just &#39;straight up&#39;, she was even bending it //back// a little bit.

You&#39;d been ready to brag about how you could almost sorta do the splits, but now you realized that was a bare minimum. &lt;&lt;if $traitChubby&gt;&gt;This did nothing to help your self conciousness. You were already painfully aware of how obvious your stomach was in this leotard. As far as you could tell no other girl in this whole gym had a pound of fat on them. Meanwhile you were shamefully displaying several.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $traitCatgirl&gt;&gt;At least mom had hidden your @@.girlVoice;cat tail and ears@@ so you didn&#39;t have to worry about being even more of an outlier.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Even as Sophie finished running you through her warm up routine you knew this &#39;light&#39; introduction was going to be pretty serious.

[[Time to get started|Vignette Gymnastics 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="820" name="Vignette Gymnastics 3" tags="" position="1225,10225" size="100,100">You watched as Sophie hurled herself over the vault at a terrifying speed. She had kept it &#39;simple&#39;, with no twists or flips, but you still weren&#39;t sure you could manage the jump. &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &lt;= 7&gt;&gt;It wasn&#39;t too surprising, you were younger than Sophie so you wouldn&#39;t be as capable as much.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;The two of you were almost the same age, but her fitness level made you look pathetic.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; The transformation you&#39;d undergone at the sleepover had left you as, what you thought, was an &#39;almost average&#39; little girl. With every moment you were revising that assessment down further. &lt;&lt;if $traitClumsy&gt;&gt;You bit your lip, maybe this whole thing had been a mistake. You were @@.girlVoice;clumsy@@ at the best of times, this seemed like a recipe for disaster.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Still you had to at least give it a try. Sophie had been nice enough to invite you, and was being as supportive as she could. So you made a run up...only to miss the timing and get basically no height off of the vault. Losing all forward momentum and just landing back on the vault itself. You felt like an idiot just standing there, motionless. Made worse because you could see a few other gymnasts watching your failure out of the corner of their eyes.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;It&#39;s okay!&quot;@@ Sophie offered, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;here, let me show you again.&quot;@@

You let Sophie take another run at it. Doing your best to examine every part of her movements so that you&#39;d be able to replicate something like it.

You weren&#39;t about to start doing anything crazy, but you were able to make it over the vault. Once you&#39;d even managed to &#39;stick the landing&#39;, or at least a close enough approximation of it.

After a while longer Sophie declared that it was time to take a break. You sat off to the side, watching as another girl stepped up to practice. She was tiny, no more than six. Which made it all the more disheartening when she launched herself into a, to your eye, perfect twist and a perfect landing.

Sophie noticed your attention, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;she&#39;s quite good isn&#39;t she?&quot;@@ There was genuine admiration in her voice, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;but don&#39;t worry about it, she&#39;s been practising since she was two.&quot;@@

[[More practice|Vignette Gymnastics 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="822" name="Vignette Gymnastics 5" tags="" position="225,10350" size="100,100">For the remainder of the session you were aware that Sophie was taking great pains to keep things at your level. You appreciated the concern and it did help quite a bit. Things were still awkward and difficult at times, but at least you were able to succeed at a few of the moves.
&lt;&lt;if $bubblyTitle&gt;&gt;\
	A fact that you were @@.girlVoice;thrilled@@ by. You couldn&#39;t help but give yourself a little @@.girlVoice;cheer@@ when you managed to make your entire way across the beam without falling. Sophie smiled, but you got a glare from one of the other girls.

	This had been a growing trend through the day. Every time you got @@.girlVoice;excited@@ or @@.girlVoice;giggled@@ or really made any noise at all, you got nasty looks.

	Most of the glares came from girls older than you, making it more intimidating. Sophie tried to assuage your concerns, but it made you feel rather out of place. Everyone here was so serious. To you it didn&#39;t seem like any of them were having any fun at all. Like that little girl who&#39;d done the flip, how was no one telling her how amazing she was?
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	One thing you were struck by as you continued was how quiet the gym actually was. You were used to the clank of metal. Weights hitting weights and an over-abundance of unnecessarily loud grunting. 

	Sophie explained that, though the physical part of gymnastics was important, there was an artistic side as well. You had to make every move look @@.girlVoice;beautiful@@ and @@.girlVoice;effortless@@. Grunting like a caveman was anathema to that. So even during practice they tried to cultivate and @@.girlVoice;elegance@@. &lt;&lt;if $traitSoftspoken&gt;&gt;You wouldn&#39;t say you were @@.girlVoice;elegant@@, but you were good at @@.girlVoice;staying quiet@@.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Another thing that you were lagging grossly behind in.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You wiped at your brow, panting. &lt;&lt;if $traitDainty&gt;&gt;Normally you wouldn&#39;t have done something this 
vigorous, but Sophie&#39;s energy was infectious.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; You weren&#39;t sure how long you&#39;d been at this, but fatigue was starting to catch up with you. Turned out children having infinite energy wasn&#39;t as absolute as they said.

Her encouragement was enough that it made you really consider it. If you started training, //hard//, right now, maybe you actually could get yourself competent. Mom might even be willing to give you a little magical boost to help you on your way.

So you nodded back to Sophie, you&#39;d think about it for sure. &lt;&lt;if $selfConciousClothingCount &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;But right now you&#39;d feel most comfortable back outside, with Sophie being the only one teasing you.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;But right now you&#39;d feel most comfortable getting back into regular clothes and having something at least cover your thighs.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Your mother looked surprised. She&#39;d never told you about what exact fate you were trying to avoid, but you had to know it was severe. It was almost brave to face an unknown punishment like that...and also terribly foolish.

You winced as the magic took hold. It felt like your whole body was being squeezed. You knew you were shrinking down, but the rest of your senses were a confusing mash.

A few more moments and you found yourself in the kitchen, though since Emily was carrying you over her shoulder you couldn&#39;t actually see what was coming. Trying to turn your head more than a few degrees and you&#39;d lose grip and risk falling.

You shifted in place trying to get more comfortable only to realize that without the support of the headrest behind you couldn&#39;t even hold your head up properly.

Your mother and sister got to work preparing the house for the sudden arrival of the new baby. Both of them were in a similar emotional state. A little confused, but filled with a nervous excitement.

Mom nodded, moving her hands through a series of odd gestures. You felt tingles spreading through your body, but they were weak, almost ticklish. Mom frowned before moving through another set, murmuring something under her breath. The tingles grew stronger but even you could tell that something was off.

Finally the sensations coalesced into something more tangible and you could feel your body begin to change. You stretched and fidgeted as your limbs lengthened. As muscles returned you were regaining proper control. You couldn&#39;t test it right now, but you knew that you&#39;d at least regained your ability to stand. A few more moments and you&#39;d be able to walk again.

You braced yourself for the continued changes, a small concern building at the back of your mind about how much weight this table could bear. It wasn&#39;t a real changing table so it could probably handle some serious weight. But a hundred plus pound man was a far cry from a dozen pound baby girl.

However, you didn&#39;t seem to be reaching that size any time soon. The changes had been quick at first but they seemed to be slowing down. You&#39;d quickly progressed through infancy and toddler-hood but now you seemed to be languishing as a young child.

Mom noticed the same and once again began to mumble.

[[Her hands moved over you|Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="851" name="Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 2" tags="" position="100,10725" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;set $playerAge to 7&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;set $hairLength to &quot;medium length&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Your changes began to progress again. More of the baby fat shrinking off of your body being replaced by a modicum of muscle. It wasn&#39;t like you were anywhere near strong, but at least you&#39;d be able to walk without worrying about falling over.

After that minimal progress the changes came to a stop again. Your mom&#39;s redoubled efforts didn&#39;t seem to be making any progress, you couldn&#39;t feel anything but the lightest of tingles. The magic faded away and your body settled into it&#39;s final form.

Mom was breathing hard and taking a break. You sat up and took s quick look in a nearby mirror. Embarrassingly you were still clad in nothing but a diaper. You were clearly too old for one, but the magic had made sure that it continued to fit. There was a dark amusement that the same thing probably would have happened, even if your progression had reached it&#39;s intended age.

Instead you were still a little blonde girl sitting on a table wearing a diaper. Your resemblance with Emily was unsurprising, at the moment the two of you were sisters, though you were a little bit younger. No doubt she&#39;d get a kick out of that, not that you intended to stay this size much longer.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Mommy?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Your head had cleared quite a bit and you could speak properly again. However, it was also a far cry from where it should be. You were struggling to find the right words to ask your next question and you couldn&#39;t help but see your mom as, well, mom. &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Why am I still widdle?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You knew that didn&#39;t sound quite right, but that was a concern for later.

Mom took a moment to consider the matter, @@.momVoice;&quot;It seems that magic did more of a number on you than I had expected. Whatever effect caused it to run so far out of control was still holding on. For the moment I can&#39;t seem to push you past this age, at least not mentally.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Menwawy?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Mommy frowed, @@.momVoice;&quot;Yes sweetie. Your mind had almost slipped away to just being an infant. It&#39;s proven hard to pull back...I&#39;ll need some time,&quot;@@ she paused for a moment, @@.momVoice;&quot;go downstairs and have breakfast with the other girls. I&#39;ll be down shortly.&quot;@@

[[You went downstairs|Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="852" name="Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 3" tags="" position="225,10725" size="100,100">You were already half way down the stairs when you realized you were still wearing nothing more than a diaper. Maybe it was just because of everything else going on, but it @@.girlVoice;didn&#39;t really feel weird to wear@@. Still, you weren&#39;t about to let the girls see you that way. You hurried back up, quickly raiding Emily&#39;s closet for something that looked like it fit. 

A long dress seemed to be your best bet for the moment. As embarrassing as you knew the diaper should be, you didn&#39;t have access to other underwear and needed to wear something. This should at least cover it until mom was focused enough to help you.

Timidly you went back downstairs. Knowing the girls would have no idea that you would look like this, and paranoid that they&#39;d somehow know the full details of your makeshift outfit.

Emily was the first one to spot you sneaking into the kitchen. @@.emilyVoice;&quot;&lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;!&quot;@@ She ran up to you, coming to a stop only a few inches from you. Looming over you by a few inches, confirming that she was taller and likely older, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;Mommy thought you should play with us a little longer?&quot;@@

You nodded, it seemed like as good a reason as any and required way less explanation. &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I pway a widdle wonner.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; That was rough and you knew it. You should be about seven, but you were talking like you were a toddler.

Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, all the girls seemed to think that was @@.girlVoice;incredibly adorable@@. You spent the rest of breakfast trying to speak as little as possible, even as the girls tried to goad you into it.

[[You ate|Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="853" name="Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 4" tags="" position="350,10725" size="100,100">Finally your mom came down to rescue you, but by the look on her face it didn&#39;t seem like the news was good.

It wasn&#39;t. It seemed that your little foray into infancy had left some pretty dramatic mental ramifications. The kind that definitely shouldn&#39;t have happened, but definitely did. She was vague on the exact reasons and you wondered if she just didn&#39;t know, but didn&#39;t want to reveal that. The summation was that, for the moment, you were stuck like this. Emily was of course delighted. The other girls were less convinced. After all you&#39;d been quite the jerk at the party, they didn&#39;t want any more of you regardless of age. Emily, who was going to have to deal with you no matter how old you were, was much more enthused by the idea of an @@.girlVoice;annoying little sister@@, than an annoying big brother.

It turned out to be something she got to enjoy for the entirety of the next week. You&#39;d taken the week off school, since you couldn&#39;t exactly show up to your high school classes like this. Mom ran all sorts of tests and cast lots of spells on you, but nothing seemed to change the reality of the situation. A reality that you were begrudgingly having to deal with. Each day bringing new realizations.

First it turned out that your speech errors from the first day weren&#39;t going away. It was a strange sensation having an inkling that something was wrong, but still continually making the same mistakes. Some of the mistakes were normal enough for a seven year old, but others were more common with five, four, and even three year olds. Which made it all the odder that your writing was, by grade 2 standards, not too bad. Mom said that it was because your brain had progressed and regressed somewhat haphazardly. 

But that wasn&#39;t much comfort when you had to &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&#39;pway\&#39;&quot;&gt;&gt; with your &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&#39;sissie\&#39;&quot;&gt;&gt;. Or when you needed a &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&#39;brewa\&#39;&quot;&gt;&gt; to go out in the &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&#39;wain\&#39;&quot;&gt;&gt;. Those were at least understandable. You had another terrible habit of just dropping the last syllables of words. This could leave you entirely incomprehensible, no one knew what you meant when you&#39;d said &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&#39;I wan weed boo\&#39;&quot;&gt;&gt;. 

[[That wasn&#39;t all|Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 5]]
&lt;&lt;set $hairstyle to 3&gt;&gt;\</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="854" name="Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 5" tags="" position="475,10725" size="100,100">The girls never found out about your diaper and it mercifully wasn&#39;t something that you had to wear again. At least not during the day. As you&#39;d found out on that first night, your bladder control while sleeping was basically non-existent. Mom insisted it actually wasn&#39;t too unusual for girls your age, but every time it happened you felt like a baby. Emily didn&#39;t tease you about it at all, which only made it worse. You knew she&#39;d kicked that habit well before school, so her not teasing you meant that her &#39;baby sister&#39; was too delicate a target.

Your motor skills in general were underdeveloped from where they should be. You&#39;d been right about the fact you could stand and walk properly. But your hands weren&#39;t quite as cooperative. Dressing yourself was a major obstacle and shoe tying seemed to be entirely impossible. Both mom and Emily were very helpful with both issues, but again it was another prick to your pride. So many things you could no longer do, when they&#39;d once been automatic. 

Over the course of the week all of the other girls visited again, driving your home your deficiencies. Kara proved herself to be shockingly smarter than you were now. Sophie was impossibly athletic by comparison. Even Miki was proving both smarter and fitter than you in most activities. Something that you professed to your mother when you finally reached your breaking point.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;You hafta chain me ba.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

@@.momVoice;&quot;&#39;Change me back&#39;.&quot;@@ Your mother gently corrected, carefully enunciating every word. She&#39;d had to do that a lot lately, but for whatever reason the lessons weren&#39;t sticking. Stupid little kid brain.

With Emily&#39;s contributions it grew even stronger.&quot;@@ 

She sighed, @@.momVoice;&quot;but your behaviour was so appalling that it was working overtime to make you fit in. And it continued it&#39;s work even after I made you into a baby. When I tried to turn you back, instead of being dispelled, the two magics combined. Which is why you mostly look seven, but lack motor control. It&#39;s also why you write like a second grader, but sometimes speak like you&#39;re three.&quot;@@

Mom was saying a lot, but none of this sounded like a way to turn you back. She confirmed your suspicions, @@.momVoice;&quot;Which means you&#39;ll be staying like this.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I hafta gwow up dis way?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; There was an obvious quaver in your voice. It was one thing to get stuck as a little girl for a sleepover. Another thing entirely to have to grow up as one.

@@.momVoice;&quot;No,&quot;@@ her voice was firm but gentle, you got the feeling she&#39;d thought about how to present this, @@.momVoice;&quot;you&#39;re going to stay exactly like this for a very long time.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I don wanna be a widdle giwl! Dis isn faiw!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Your panic was rising. She had to be missing something, you couldn&#39;t get stuck like this for years. &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Thewe ha be wawa.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Mommy quirked her head in confusion. It seemed your speech degraded further when you got stressed, even she didn&#39;t understand that sentence.

Mom at least understood this time, @@.momVoice;&quot;I know sweetie. But there is simply nothing left to be done. I&#39;ve consulted with every colleague I could find.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I wan twy neway,\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you didn&#39;t care about a few side effects, you wanted to be sixteen again. To be able to speak like an adult.

She shook her head, @@.momVoice;&quot;As much as I know you hate this, it is better than the alternatives. Unless you&#39;d like to be a sixteen year old girl with the mind of a toddler. At least this way you can read, and even write a little. With that choice you&#39;d be doing little more than babbling. And that was the //best// option.&quot;@@

You reeled, apparently there were things worse than your current fate. You didn&#39;t want to lose any more of your mind. You&#39;d experienced infancy only a week ago and had no desire to go back.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Don&#39;t worry sweetie. Mommy will be right here to take care of you.&quot;@@ Her voice was as gentle as possible. Whatever she&#39;d had planned for this party, it wasn&#39;t this. There was genuine regret in her eyes, she wanted to make this right, but simply couldn&#39;t. You bore some responsibility for the outcome, if you hadn&#39;t acted so reprehensibly it never would have gone this far. But how could you have known?

[[Time marched on|Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="857" name="Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 8" tags="" position="850,10725" size="100,100">Mom kept her word. She was always there to take care of you despite the strangeness of the situation. You&#39;d spent several months grieving your lost life, as middling as it had been. @@.girlVoice;Pouting, raging, sulking and screaming@@ in equal measure. Mom was patient through all of it. Even Emily had apologized for how things turned out. 

But none of that changed the reality of the situation. Though eventually even you calmed down. It was hard to stay that indignant for that long. Humans can get used to anything given enough time. 

Another issue was the soul-crushing boredom. You&#39;d barely left the house during that time and you avoided the other girls when they came over. You&#39;d started to crave social interaction that wasn&#39;t Emily or mom. Mom suggested you go to school, if only as a distraction. A suggestion you eventually begrudgingly accepted. 

&lt;&lt;if !$girlName&gt;&gt;\
	Since $playerName wasn&#39;t exactly a sensible name for a 7 year old girl you&#39;d been forced to take a new one. It&#39;d been the subject of much debate between the girls, but they&#39;d finally decided on @@.girlVoice;Bunny@@. It was a name that would only work for a very young girl. Past the age of ten it would just be a source of derision. But since you weren&#39;t going to age... 
	&lt;&lt;set $girlName to &quot;Bunny&quot;&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
School was a mixed bag. It was nice having others around, but they were all children. Though your brain was on par with theirs when it came to intelligence, you still had the memories of an older boy. Which made it all the more frustrating that the actual lessons were a nightmare. When mom had said you wouldn&#39;t grow up you didn&#39;t quite realize that your mind was locked at the same level. Some classes you could handle, but others went further and further beyond your capabilities. 

A normal child would have been learning to keep up with the increasingly complex content, but you @@.girlVoice;couldn&#39;t seem to learn anything@@ new. It wasn&#39;t that you forgot that you&#39;d learned it. Your memory was fine, but the lessons never stuck. You could add little numbers, but multiplication and division continued to be a mystery no matter how many times you had it explained.

The teachers were concerned. It didn&#39;t help that your speech was, in their experience, seriously developmentally delayed. Eventually she was forced to pull you out to prevent too many awkward questions. But it seemed she had some contingencies. After all it was going to be suspicious if you kept taking the same grade and never seemed to grow.

[[You switched schools|Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 9]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="858" name="Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 9" tags="" position="975,10725" size="100,100">This time you were put into Grade 1. Your limitations were less apparent here. It was only near the end of the year that a few concepts seemed to be stretching beyond your capabilities. Your speech skills were, though clearly lagging, not as concerning for that grade. 

At the end of the year your mom was given the suggestion to get additional speech lessons over the summer. She dutifully nodded, though she knew enrolling you would be useless. Instead she planned where you would attend next year. This repeated several times. Each new year was a whole new set of classmates, but they temporary friends that couldn&#39;t last.

As an additional layer of safety you also had to change your name with each new school. @@.girlVoice;Minnie, Boo, Cookie,@@ each more @@.girlVoice;childish and girly@@ than the last. But stuck in Grade 1 it just came across @@.girlVoice;cute.@@

Meanwhile the girls of the group continued to grow. It wasn&#39;t long before you were the youngest in the group, struggling to keep up with their activities. A little longer and they were too old to let you play at all. It was a shocking experience when Emily had grown big enough that she could pick you up. You&#39;d long ago come to terms with being the @@.girlVoice;&#39;little sister&#39;@@ but now you felt well and truly like the @@.girlVoice;&#39;baby sister&#39;@@.

As she continued to grow she started drifting further and further from you, the age gap making it harder to properly sympathize with you. It wasn&#39;t that she was being mean, but she was a pre-teen now. It wasn&#39;t that much fun to hang out with a little kid. It was only now that you finally started to understand Emily&#39;s frustrations from all those years ago.

[[But there was hope|Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="859" name="Nightmare Ending Last Second Escape 10" tags="" position="1100,10725" size="100,100">It wasn&#39;t much but the previous year you&#39;d actually grown a little, and the lock on your mind had begun to loosen. It wasn&#39;t enough to actually let you move on to grade 2, but it was a step in the right direction. It was hopeful that this year might be the last time you had to go through this.

For now you had to get ready for your latest first day. You&#39;d newly been christened @@.girlVoice;Hope@@ just in time for Grade 1 at a new school. It was a girly name, and perhaps a little bit on the nose, but it was special to you. This was a name you could grow up with. 

In truth it was actually an old school, enough time had passed to pass you off as a younger sister. There were only so many schools in town after all. You weren&#39;t very nervous, by now you were an expert at this. It&#39;d be no problem to make yourself, if not liked, at least tolerated by everyone.

Though you still felt butterflies when you saw your new classmates. Classmates that you might just grow up with. This wasn&#39;t you trying to make casual acquaintances to just get through the year. Some of these boys and girls might become friends for life.

It&#39;d been a long path to get here, but you were finally ready to start your new life. You were confident it&#39;d be better than your last. In all those years you hadn&#39;t been able to learn a thing about math, but you had finally learned a lesson about kindness, and wasn&#39;t that the most important lesson of all?

She was a nerd, fascinated by comic books and anime, while you eschewed all of that stuff. And it wasn&#39;t like she&#39;d aggressively sought out the friendship, she was far too reserved to do that. Still, something about her had made you grow a fondness for her.

			The girl was shockingly intelligent. There were obvious gaps in her knowledge, she was still quite young, but she had a fast and precise mind. More than once she&#39;d surprised you with some insight that you had missed. Yet she never lorded that over anyone. She could think circles around the rest of the group, but she always stayed humble about it. 

			Perhaps too humble. You doubted that Kara was able to see how amazing she actually was. Too often she got bowled over by the more forceful personalities of Emily and Sophie. Her clever ideas being adopted by the group, but not receiving her due credit. But you&#39;d noticed. In the course of the party you&#39;d had little chance to impress that upon her but going forward you&#39;d endeavour to do so. That girl deserved someone to help her see her own brilliance.

The idea of a nine year old girl challenging a sixteen year old boy seemed laughable on the face of it. But something in her eyes had made you realize she was serious.

			Over the course of the party you found that all that arrogance was confidence. She was able to back up her braggadocious words and prove herself in those challenges. Even at sixteen you sometimes failed to outdo her. &lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt;= 12&gt;&gt;As you&#39;d gotten younger, her aptitude became even more apparent. Even when you were few years older it was always a struggle to try and keep up with her.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt;= 9&gt;&gt;By the time you were her age it seemed almost hopeless.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerAge &lt;= 8&gt;&gt;Once she was bigger than you, the best you could manage was to follow her lead.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

			She&#39;d look at you, those eyes would sparkle defiantly and you&#39;d find yourself drawn into another silly contest. Though sometimes the intensity of that gaze made you want to just sit back and watch, to see what she was capable of. She was an impressive girl, and you @@.girlVoice;wanted to keep watching@@.

Emily was always energetic and bubbly, but she was a prankster at heart. Miki had just as much energy, but also with an abundance of empathy. She didn&#39;t seem to bear anyone any ill will and got the most upset when others were feeling low.

			Despite all the things that were happening at the sleepover you always felt like Miki was &#39;on your side&#39;. She&#39;d be the one to reach out her hand when you were feeling self concious or stressed. Playing with her always ended up being a relief. You didn&#39;t have to worry about traps and tricks, Miki just wanted some innocent fun. 

			It was an attitude that rubbed off on you&lt;&lt;if $oldPlayerMaturity &lt;= 14&gt;&gt;, often literally. Playing with her often had a persistent detrimental effect on your mental maturity, but with her it always just made you enjoy yourself more&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.

She was annoyingly persistent, always pestering you to do some new inane task. She never left you alone despite the fact you&#39;d made it clear you weren&#39;t interested. She was a brat through and through.

			Though as your brain circled on the thought there was another feeling lurking behind your annoyance. A justification for all of that unwarranted distaste. Jealousy.

			Your concious mind would never admit it, but you were jealous of Emily. That &#39;immature&#39; outlook meant that she could find fun even in mundane tasks. Whereas you spent most of your life bored. She had an energy an excitement that meant she always wanted to try something new, while you&#39;d gotten stuck in the same habits.

Her know it all attitude was a constant source of frustration for you.

			Though as your brain circled on the thought there was another feeling lurking behind your annoyance. A justification for all of that unwarranted distaste. Jealousy.

			Your concious mind would never admit it, but you were jealous of Kara. You&#39;d never excelled at school, never had the intelligence or focus to be able to learn like she did.

			Your concious mind would never admit it, but you were jealous of Sophie. Your dislike for her &#39;arrogance&#39;, a cover for your own insecurity.

			Though as your brain circled on the thought there was another feeling lurking behind your annoyance. A justification for all of that unwarranted distaste. Jealousy.

			Your concious mind would never admit it, but you were jealous of Miki. The girl was fundamentally happy in a way you could barely understand. Nothing seemed to bring her down, she was able to bring light to any situation, regardless of the darkness.

	The truth of your feelings danced at the edge of your understanding. An awareness of the fundamental source of your animosity, but buried too deep to penetrate to your concious mind.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

The memory of these dreams faded only moments after you awoke, but a part of the feeling lingered. It was an omen for what was about to come next.

[[Go downstairs|The Trial 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="865" name="Nightmare Ending Dream" tags="" position="600,10850" size="100,100">Your dreams were strange, it was difficult to even explain them. Everything was just so abstract, colors and shapes and sounds all connected in ways you didn&#39;t understand. It was clear that your mind was trying to work something out, but wasn&#39;t capable of making sense of the stimulus you were getting.

There was an ever building sense of dread and the weight of your behaviour on the day came crashing down on you. This party had supposed to be a chance for you and Emily to make up. To better understand her and her friends. 

Instead they liked you even less than before. Despite everything they&#39;d done to try to include you in their games you&#39;d been an ass to them at almost every turn.

You could almost feel your mother&#39;s anger at the situation, about your complete inability to learn a lesson. You didn&#39;t know what her response would be, but you doubted you&#39;d enjoy it. When you awoke perhaps it would be best to apologize, profusely, to the girls and to your mother. Hope that they might be lenient in whatever punishment was planned. Or maybe you had no regrets over what you&#39;d done, the girls were a bunch of brats and they&#39;d deserved that kind of treatment. You&#39;d accept whatever fate had in store.

As you awoke there was a tinge of disappointment to seeing your body restored to normal. It wasn&#39;t that you&#39;d wanted to stay changed, you liked who you were, but it did mean that the fun was over. Though as you shifted in your sleeping bag you realized one thing that hadn&#39;t changed much. A quick peek into the bag confirmed it, you still had your @@.girlVoice;&lt;&lt;print getCurrentOutfit().name&gt;&gt;@@ on, somehow in your size.

Considering everything else that had gone on, this was a minor point. Though for reasons you couldn&#39;t quite explain you kept them on even as you headed downstairs, maybe the girls would get a laugh out of seeing them.

So how could you go about this? Potentially you&#39;d be able to find something in your mothers closet, but this had several things working against it. One, your mother was much more well endowed than you currently were, so anything in her closet wouldn&#39;t fit. The second issue being how mad she might be if you messed with her stuff, you didn&#39;t need another angry witch. The third being that the idea of wearing your mother&#39;s clothes of your own free will was uncomfortable at best. It was possible her closet had similar magical properties to Emily&#39;s, but that didn&#39;t fix issues two and three. 

Which left the question of whether any of the girls had one. Normally wearing their clothes would also be a no go, but you were already in an outfit, including underwear, provided by Emily so that ship had sailed. You guessed that Emily was too young to have one, but you didn&#39;t actually know. This wasn&#39;t something you&#39;d had to pay attention to until now. Sophie was the other potential source, but wouldn&#39;t the size be wrong? Did bras stretch? You didn&#39;t want to ask either of them //any// of these questions. &lt;&lt;if $karaInferiorityComplex &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;But you //knew// that Kara would know the answers, even if she was too young to wear one herself.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;However, despite being too young for one, you had a hunch Kara would at least //know// about the situation.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

This was all uncharted territory and any path forward was going to be embarrassing.

Not only would she know what to do, but she was the only one who might be discreet enough not to blab to the rest of the group.

It took some doing, but you were finally able to get her away from the group long enough for a little conversation.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Kara I...\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You looked down at the seven year old, realizing you were asking for a favour from someone less than half your old age, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I need a favour.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Kara stayed quiet as you stumbled through the awkward question, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I need a bra.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Your voice was barely above a whisper even though the others were in a different room. &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Do you know if Emily or Sophie have one?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

You impatiently awaited her answer, worrying about not only her reaction but what might come next. Assuming they did have one, how were you going to get ahold of it?

@@.karaVoice;&quot;They don&#39;t,&quot;@@ Kara&#39;s voice was grave, @@.karaVoice;&quot;and don&#39;t ask Sophie about it. She-&quot;@@ Kara cast a glance towards the other room, @@.karaVoice;&quot;she just doesn&#39;t have one.&quot;@@

Glumly you nodded, looked like you were going to have to deal with this discomfort a while longer. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;=11&gt;&gt;Hopefully you&#39;d get a little younger soon and they&#39;d go away.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;With how things were going you might be too young for them soon.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Your conversation having ended in a disappointing failure you once again tried to adjust your clothes as you went back to the living room. Sophie caught your eye as you did, giving you a wicked idea.

&lt;&lt;filterlinkreplace &quot;Puff out your chest&quot;&gt;&gt;\
	As you came back into the room you were sure to puff out your chest. It was probably a little //too// obvious, but it had the desired effect.

	Sophie saw the obvious bumps on your chest, reflexively looking down at her own flat chest and frowning. It was all you could do to suppress a laugh. She&#39;d never admit it to you, but her jealousy and annoyance was obvious. Seemed she&#39;d just have to wait until she grew up. 
	&lt;&lt;changeHappiness &quot;Sophie&quot; false&gt;&gt;\
	&lt;&lt;set $teasedSophieAboutChest to true&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;/filterlinkreplace&gt;&gt;

So Emily and Sophie were a bust, or more so they had a lack of bust, so it seemed that for now you&#39;d just have to put up with it.

When this happened last Emily tried to make you say @@.girlVoice;&#39;shoot&#39;@@ and Sophie had said @@.girlVoice;&#39;weewee&#39;@@.

Perhaps the most frustrating was the prohibition against &#39;mean&#39; words. Somehow &#39;bad&#39; and &#39;mean&#39; had gotten twisted in your head. It was possible, with great effort, to remember the word @@.noFilter;&#39;dumb&#39;@@, but you could //never// use it to describe someone. @@.girlVoice;Mommy@@ would be mad if you did that, and you still wanted to be a @@.girlVoice;good girl@@.

At this point you&#39;d kind of lost count, but the leftover containers looked a lot more empty than they had before. No way the girls wouldn&#39;t notice this, you&#39;d need an alibi, or at least an excuse. Maybe you could blame it on hungry mice?

Glancing once more towards the door you reached out for one last cupcake, though your body felt odd as you did. There was a sluggishness to the movement and it took more effort than before. Sure you&#39;d eaten a lot and you did feel stuffed, but this wasn&#39;t just a full stomach, you felt...heavy.

At first you couldn&#39;t see a thing, the switch from darkness into what turned out to be bright sunny day had been too much. Even shading yourself with your hand was causing you to see spots. But eventually you did recover and got a better look at what was going on around you.

This wasn&#39;t where you had fallen asleep, not even close.

You sat up and looked around. Wherever this was it was beautiful. The tall grass, a perfect green, in an endless rolling field. Patches of brightly colored flowers that pleased the eye. There were clear blue skies stretching out to the horizon. The bright sun suffused your body with a pleasant warmth, yet you got the feeling you&#39;d never get a sunburn, no matter how long you stayed in it. A gust of a gentle cool breeze seemed perfectly synced to the moments right before you might feel too hot.

&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 12&gt;&gt;Idyllic.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Perfect.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

That was the only word you could think to describe this place. It was impossibly beautiful in every way. 

But how had you gotten here? And where was here anyway?

[[You heard a giggle|Imaginary Friend Dream 1-2]]

As you turned you found yourself looking at a rather familiar face.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Emily?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

The girl smiled, and you realized you were wrong. She certainly looked a lot like Emily, but she was a year or two younger. No more than six. &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &lt;= 7&gt;&gt;She actually looked more like you than she did Emily.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; However, the real difference was in her eyes. They were the same bright blue, but Emily&#39;s always seemed to sparkle with mischief. This girl&#39;s eyes were calm and still, like a tranquil lake. She wore nothing but a simple embroidered white dress and a white flower in her hair.

With your realization complete the girl offered you her hand, @@.imaginaryFriendVoice;&quot;come on.&quot;@@

You dreamily took it. The action didn&#39;t seem like a decision to you, you just had to grab it, that was how it was. 

Hand in hand the two of you seemed to glide across the field. The girl was barefoot, but it didn&#39;t seem to bother her. Never did she encounter so much as a rough patch of dirt. You felt silly wearing your own sneakers. It was a shame not to feel the grass under your feet.

The two of you came to a stop in a particularly lovely patch of pink flowers. You didn&#39;t even know what the flowers were, but they were undoubtedly the prettiest flowers you&#39;d ever seen.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;A dream.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

She nodded, but looked almost sad, @@.imaginaryFriendVoice;&quot;nothing but a dream.&quot;@@

Seeing that sadness on her face nearly drove you mad. You wanted to hug her, to comfort her, to fix whatever vexed her. This girl looked so pure and innocent, untouched by the hardships of life. She&#39;d look so out of place anywhere that wasn&#39;t this meadow.

The beauty was the same as it had been before, but now you noticed even more. That cool breeze carried the gentle scent of flowers.

There was a lightness about her, a carefree ease that suffused her being. 

Her long blonde hair trailed out behind her as she spun, sparkling in the afternoon sunlight. Her light white dress puffed out as she spun. Pure white with simple embroidery around the shoulders and more delicate work around the hem. It was a child&#39;s dress, but a @@.girlVoice;very pretty@@ one.

The endless daytime made tracking difficult, but even beyond that the place worked on dream logic. Sometimes you&#39;d feel like running and it&#39;d take as long as you wanted to get somewhere. Other times, when you wanted to do something else, you could cross the distance immediately.

It wasn&#39;t a concious decision, it just sort of happened. Nothing here required particular thought and the more you played the more those unnecessary thoughts seemed to @@.girlVoice;fall away@@. Worries and concerns about school, or money or anything about the outside world. You could spend an eternity just @@.girlVoice;picking flowers@@ and @@.girlVoice;love every minute@@. Every activity held endless fascination, as long as you let yourself @@.girlVoice;just let go@@ and enjoy it.

@@.imaginaryFriendVoice;&quot;How are you doing?&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;print $imaginaryFriendName&gt;&gt;&#39;s voice broke you from your reverie. Looking down at the circle of flowers you&#39;d taken...minutes...hours...possibly days...to make. It didn&#39;t matter, you&#39;d loved making it.

You gave her a smile, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;perfect.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You stood, offering her your hand, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;come on.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Letting her forget any of the trials that she was now facing. Though once you stopped and sat she told you about what had happened.

She had completed the sleepover in your place. Though she&#39;d been more to happy to become a six year old girl in body as well as spirit. She&#39;d also been more than eager to stay that way once the party was over.

Everyone seemed thrilled by her new behaviour, even if they didn&#39;t fully understand the sudden change of heart. Her relationship with Emily, her mother and the other girls improved immensely and she&#39;d even started going to school in Miki&#39;s class.

You listened with rapt attention, though the situation felt distant to you. You were her friend, so of course you would listen to her problems, but you really just @@.girlVoice;wanted to play@@.

But $imaginaryFriendName couldn&#39;t just play all day, she had responsibilities and homework and a dozen other things that stole her time and attention. That&#39;s what you were there for, to pull her away from that @@.girlVoice;boring@@ stuff to have fun. To play in the yard and pretend to be @@.girlVoice;princesses@@ or @@.girlVoice;mermaids@@ or whatever $imaginaryFriendName could think of. 

$imaginaryFriendName was so creative, she could draw beautifully, write pretty stories and tell funny jokes. Everyone particularly loved stories about her closest companion, you, her @@.girlVoice;imaginary friend@@. All the wild adventures the two of you went on, even if no one else could see you.

You didn&#39;t need anyone else to see you or hear you, that wasn&#39;t important. You got to live in @@.girlVoice;paradise@@ and $imaginaryFriendName would always be with you and she was all the friend you&#39;d ever need.

Emily seemed satisfied. She finally got to be called &#39;big sis&#39; like she wanted to. Even if you were quiet now, it&#39;d surely slip out now and again. Plus she could call you &#39;little&#39; all she wanted, and you couldn&#39;t bite back.

There was a bit of a lull between events and you were looking for something to do. Without anything obvious you were about to resign yourself to just being bored when an idea scratched at your mind.

You pulled out your phone navigating back to &#39;Love Nikki&#39;. You&#39;d never actually got the chance to get that dress and it felt like leaving something terribly unresolved. You wouldn&#39;t have a lot of time, so you were going to need to get it quickly. &lt;&lt;if $traitShopaholic&gt;&gt;Which meant it was time to get back to the store. $20 and it would speed things up nicely. Annoyingly you still had to do a few other in-game things to get it. You didn&#39;t know why you couldn&#39;t just buy the dress and skip the middle man.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; But you bought what you needed to, dyed what needed color and crafted the components. 

In the end you managed to get it, a @@.girlVoice;wave of satisfaction@@ washing over you. Though there was a problem, you had the dress, but it was actually a part of a whole set...you hesitated, but you couldn&#39;t resist the allure. You&#39;d play just a little bit longer, just enough to get the set and then you&#39;d be done. It was only three items, it shouldn&#39;t be too long.

[[Play the game|Love Nikki Return 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="958" name="Love Nikki Return 2" tags="" position="975,11975" size="100,100">&lt;span id=&quot;nikkiImage&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;Image &#39;VideoGames/Stills/Love-KiteElfSuit.webp&#39; &#39;medium&#39;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\

Once again you needed to dye some existing items in order to get them in the right color. &lt;&lt;if $traitFashionista&gt;&gt;Technically you could go with a different color, but the mere idea was @@.girlVoice;horrifying@@ to you. @@.girlVoice;Fashion dictated that it should match.@@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Luckily most of the items were just available in the store.

delight. Things could not be going better. &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; had truly thrown themselves into the party, making it a joy for both him and the girls. He already seemed to be part of the party in spirit, his body and mind were sure to follow. Just another little girl enjoying the party.
&lt;&lt;elseif _groupHappiness &gt;= 21&gt;&gt;\
pleasure. Things were going well, &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;&#39;d managed to integrate well into the party and was managing to enjoy himself. The magic would just continue nudging him along, helping him enjoy himself more as he became more and more part of the party.
&lt;&lt;elseif _groupHappiness &gt;= 11&gt;&gt;\
concern. It wasn&#39;t a complete disaster, but &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; was still stubbornly resisting. The magic would just keep pushing him harder and harder the more he resisted. There was so much fun to be had at the sleepover, if only he was willing to accept it. Though she couldn&#39;t entirely blame him; this was so far from him experience of the last sixteen years. 
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
disappointment. This was worse than she could have imagined. &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; seemed to be actively bringing misery to both himself and the rest of the girls. &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; seemed to hate the mere idea of enjoying himself. For whatever reason, he was too protective and self-concious about his own masculinity and maturity to even entertain anything feminine or adolescent, no matter how much fun it would be. 
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

There was a lot of the party left, so things still could change. No point in counting chickens before they&#39;d hatched. No telling if &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; would really be able to learn their lesson. She&#39;d just have to wait and see.

Emily&#39;s mother watched the continued goings on of the party with a \
&lt;&lt;if _groupHappiness &gt;= 35&gt;&gt;\
wide smile. It felt like she&#39;d already succeeded. &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;&#39;s participation was basically indistinguishable from the rest of the girls &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &gt;= 12&gt;&gt;even if he still didn&#39;t look the part.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Perhaps &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; would be amenable to spending even more time this way.
&lt;&lt;elseif _groupHappiness &gt;= 21&gt;&gt;\
smile. Things were still looking hopeful. &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; was mostly participating and was already quite friendly with &lt;&lt;print getBestFriend()&gt;&gt;. If the lesson wasn&#39;t completely learned perhaps a little more time in a form that allowed them to stay close to &lt;&lt;print getBestFriend()&gt;&gt; would finish the job.
&lt;&lt;elseif _groupHappiness &gt;= 11&gt;&gt;\
frown. Things weren&#39;t looking promising and time was running out. &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; was still harshly resisting the sleepover and it&#39;d put him in near constant conflict with &lt;&lt;print getWorstEnemy()&gt;&gt;. She could see how much of that resistance was just bitterness, seeing things in &lt;&lt;print getWorstEnemy()&gt;&gt; that he subconsciously wanted to experience, but his concious mind rejected the idea. Perhaps, if the sleepover wasn&#39;t enough, $they could be given a little time in a different form. One with the freedom to enjoy those things without shame.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
deep frown. It seemed almost hopeless at this point. &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; had seemingly hated the entire sleepover and there wasn&#39;t enough time left to recover the situation. She&#39;d need to do something drastic to have any hope of getting the message across. &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; just couldn&#39;t let himself enjoy things, they were too attached to $their manhood and maturity. Perhaps if both were stripped completely it would give him a chance to finally let go...
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

She felt a small pang of guilt having put &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; into such a situation. He was supposed to be the mature one, even if Emily was a brat sometimes it was his perojative to rise above it. Instead he let himself go down to her level and acted like a child. His behaviour had been unacceptable and needed to be punished.

There were more straightforward methods of course, but this particular path had resonated. It would give &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; a chance to understand life at Emily&#39;s level, both the things she enjoyed and the things she hated. That closeness should breed a familiarity that strengthened their relationship. Emily might even grow a little as a pleasant side effect.

Though she was nagged by another thought. &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;&#39;s life so far had been, well she&#39;d never say it directly, but a disspointment. He seemed to have an unease with his very being, struggling to find himself. This wasn&#39;t uncommon with teenagers, but it&#39;d been a problem his entire life. He had few friends, none of them close, his marks were middling at best, he simply lacked the kind of motivation needed to excel at anything. 

Perhaps he would be better suited to another life, restarting things with a few tweaks. This sleepover was a chance for him to explore that other path, maybe find a life he&#39;d enjoy better.

Was Emily really serious about these hair clips? Were they really the only thing keeping your hair from growing longer? Or was this just another tease on Emily&#39;s part? Maybe she just wanted you stuck in these @@.girlVoice;girly@@ hair clips for her own amusement.

Glancing around you it seemed that no one else was looking, a perfect opportunity for a little experiment. You fumbled around, removing the first clip and waited...but nothing happened.

Feeling emboldened you went to remove the second, this was a mistake. The moment the second clip came undone your entire head began to tingle. You watched in terrified fascination as your hair, already pooling on the floor started to grow again.

In a panic you re-clipped it, but the growth didn&#39;t even slow. It had already gained a couple extra inches and showed no signs of stopping. You hurried to get the other one back on, your haste making it slower than if you&#39;d actually managed to do it calmly. 

You finally got it clipped, breathing a sigh of relief; with the clips restored your hair had stopped its growth.

Out of the corner of your eye you realized that Emily was watching you, and by her smile she&#39;d seen at least some of your little &#39;experiment&#39;. You looked away sheepishly, @@.girlVoice;innocently twirling a lock of your even longer hair@@. Lesson learned, don&#39;t mess with magic hair clips.

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
This was the first time you&#39;d ever worn anything like this.

There was only a little hesitation before you grabbed the door handle. Surely she wouldn&#39;t have set something up, that&#39;d be too dangerous. What if there had been an emergency? There had to be a way to get out.

Your hand was still tingling, but other than that you felt fine. If anything your body felt *better* than it had before. You got yourself into a seated position, stretching your arms above your head.

@@.girlVoice;&quot;Nyaaaaa.&quot;@@

Your eyes went wide at the sound. You hadn&#39;t meant to say it, it just came out naturally. The other girls were grinning wide at the @@.girlVoice;adorable@@ noise.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;What&#39;s going on?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You fixed your gaze upon the group.

Miki gasped at your stare, while Emily and Kara seemed fascinated.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;You might want to check the mirror.&quot;@@ The grin that accompanied Sophie&#39;s words was slightly concerning.

Annoyed at their vague words you hopped up onto to your feet. You *did* feel good. Not that standing was hard or anything, but you felt like you could have done a @@.nofilter;flip@@ if you wanted. Though that good mood only made what you saw in the mirror all the more shocking.

Tentatively you reached up to pull on one, wincing at the sensation when you did. They were definitely real, and definitely attached to your head.

The other change was a little harder to see. You opened your mouth, pulling on the side with one finger to see better. Yup, as you&#39;d suspected, your canine teeth were significantly sharper than they had been before. Though not so intense as to be anything but @@.girlVoice;cute@@.

Oddly the whole process had calmed you down rather than freaked you out more. No doubt some magic was at play, making you accept the changes. But it did mean you were sedate enough to not try escaping again.

It took a moment for your brain to parse the single word sentence. In truth you still weren&#39;t sure about your new appendages, let alone letting other people touch them. They were sensitive, what if they pulled too hard? Or rubbed the wrong way?

But the look in Kara&#39;s eyes made it seem like she&#39;d never wanted something more in her entire life. It&#39;d probably make her night and the others would like it as well.

Luckily they all seemed to be aware enough that they were attached, and it would hurt if they pulled too hard. So they mostly contented themselves stroking your new &lt;&lt;print $playerHairColor&gt;&gt; fur.

Though you found it a little difficult to disagree on that point at the current moment. All the stroking was shockingly soothing, you actually felt yourself almost off drifting to sleep. A noise rumbling in your throat that vaguely approximated a purr.

The question was how to go about getting it. It was always on her person, but she didn&#39;t seem to be very cautious. She probably thought you&#39;d never do anything that rash.

In the few minutes before the next activity you did your best to keep an eye on her, looking for weaknesses. It didn&#39;t take long.

Looking around did little to reduce the oddity of a situation. You were in a classroom, or at least a copy of one. Rows of desks, blackboard, walls covered in all sorts of posters and banners. But outside the windows there didn&#39;t seem to be anything. Not &#39;empty fields&#39;, nothing. You got the eerie feeling that wherever you were began and ended in this classroom.

The classroom had it&#39;s own oddities, at least to what you were used to. Those banners and posters were cloyingly cheery and stunningly basic. One poster was just a big explanation of the &#39;right ways&#39; to read, another had a schedule in rainbow colors. One just had a bunch of basic numbers listed, like days of the week, weeks in a year, and some basic examples of addition. Further more the top of the room was ringed by the letters of the alphabet. It was pretty clear that this wasn&#39;t a high school class. It might even be a little too young for Emily. Grade 2 maybe? Maybe even Grade 1? It&#39;d been long enough since you&#39;d learned this stuff you had no idea what age you actually learned it at.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Ahem.&quot;@@ A voice cleared their throat at the front of the room. Your head snapped up to look.

A dread washed over you. Whatever you were looking at wasn&#39;t actually your mother. It looked like her, it sounded like her, but it was something else entirely. It was like one of those digital assistants. A Siri or Alexa that only knew a few phrases to respond to, otherwise it just went back to a default response.

Looking down you realized a sheet of paper and pencil had materialized on your desk. The automaton masquerading as your mother just stood at the front of the room, unmoving, staring at you. It was deeply unnerving. 

It didn&#39;t look like there was any other option. There was literally nowhere to go, this room was your whole world. And no amount of cajoling was going to make a robot change it&#39;s mind. Plus how bad could a few lines be?

You picked up the pencil.

The first was proxies for curse words. &#39;Dang&#39;, &#39;fudge&#39;, &#39;gosh&#39;, were all too close to actual bad words, so they should be avoided. Basically all of those words should just be either, &#39;shoot&#39; or &#39;jeez&#39; or &#39;rats&#39;...and that was about it. Dozens of words boiled down to three or four options.

The second was &#39;potty talk&#39;. These were to be avoided if at all possible, but in the extreme case where they were needed you had to use the most @@.girlVoice;saccharine@@ version possible. &#39;Poop&#39; was &#39;poopoo&#39;, &#39;boy privates&#39; was &#39;peepee&#39;, &#39;girl privates&#39; was &#39;foofoo&#39;. Anything to take it as far away as possible from it&#39;s actual meaning.

The last was strictly banned words. These were any words that were too &#39;mean&#39; to say to other people. &#39;Stupid&#39;, &#39;dumb&#39;, &#39;fat&#39; weren&#39;t permissible descriptors and you could never tell someone to &#39;shut up&#39; or that &#39;they suck&#39;. You couldn&#39;t even say someone else was &#39;mean&#39;.

You&#39;d expected it to be annoying, what you hadn&#39;t expected was how boring this was. It&#39;s not like you had to think about what you were writing. By the dozenth attempt it was automatic and you were well past a dozen. You felt like it had been hundreds of lines, the pattern of the letters felt burned into your brain.

Eventually you resorted to singing to yourself just to have some auditory stimulus. However, as automatic as the writing was, it still consumed some of your mental capacity.

With all the ingredients acquired there was nothing left to do but make the sandwich. You got yourself onto the chair in front of the table, ready to go.

You ran into your first roadblock right away. You couldn&#39;t open the peanut butter jar, and the jelly jar was no better. The lids seemed to be fused to their respective containers and your @@.girlVoice;minuscule strength@@ wasn&#39;t making any observable progress.

You weren&#39;t about to give up now. You&#39;d gotten through this whole process without asking for help even once and you weren&#39;t about to start now. These jars would be opened even if it killed you.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
You&#39;d asked for Emily&#39;s help before, but it&#39;d been degrading. You&#39;d find a way to do this yourself. These jars would be opened even if it killed you.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

So you pushed and strained and put everything you had into shifting the welded shut jar, all the while keenly aware of the continuously building pressure. The clock was still ticking and you were out of time.

&#39;&#39;POP&#39;&#39;

The jelly jar had finally come free. Emboldened by your success it was only a few moments before...

&#39;&#39;POP&#39;&#39;

The peanut butter was free. Now all you had to do was make this sandwich before it was too late.

You were more convinced that she was an immature brat who didn&#39;t deserve any of your time. And she was...well you didn&#39;t really care what she thought of you. You weren&#39;t the one running an insane transformative slumber party. Weirdly enough that wasn&#39;t actually the thing that annoyed you the most. It was how infantile she was acting through the whole thing. Sulking when she didn&#39;t get her way, playing all these stupid baby games.

That didn&#39;t mean you didn&#39;t enjoy anything. You did get a certain amount of joy out of needling your &lt;&lt;sisterTitle&gt;&gt;. Watching all her little silly plans crumble around her, or even just getting in a good jab or two when the moment was right.

Coming to a stop in front of her you wondered if the moment was right.

Emily smiled, and moved closer to you, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;and down you go.&quot;@@

She gave another wave of her wand and the aura sprang to life. It felt like you were being gently crushed from all sides. It basically locked you in place, as moving against the pressure seemed near impossible.

A peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Normally this would be a trivial task, but in this body you doubted it&#39;d be so simple.

First a checklist, what would you need to get? Peanut butter, jelly, bread...simple enough. Oh, and a knife to spread it with. Four items then a little bit of work and Emily would have what she wanted and you could go back to normal. Time to get to work. 

You scanned the room. The jelly was high up in the fridge, the bread was on the kitchen counter, the peanut butter was in the condiment cupboard high above the bread and the knife would be in the drawer just under the counter. The only other furnishings of note was the kitchen table, in the center of the room set away from the counter and fridge and one wooden chair.

This is where the problems became apparent. The chair, normally something you didn&#39;t even think about, was now a significant obstacle. Standing in front of it the seat was level with your chest. Just &#39;sitting down&#39;, would be impossible, you&#39;d have to climb to even make it up there. Which meant the rest of the room was even worse. You couldn&#39;t even see the top of the counter if you were standing beside. If you reached up you could get a hand up there, on tip toes maybe even your wrist, but there was zero chance you could clamber your way up unaided.

	You weren&#39;t sure if the diaper made the current situation more or less embarrassing. On the one hand, you were wearing a, now wet, diaper and that was fundamentally humiliating. On the other hand it had been absorbent enough that it hadn&#39;t made any further mess. You were currently in basically a @@.girlVoice;baby&#39;s@@ body, was this really unexpected?

	Though you couldn&#39;t see it, the flowers had disappeared from the front of the diaper. It&#39;s presence letting anyone who&#39;d ever dealt with a baby know exactly what had happened.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	It turned out that the training pants were a mercy. As embarrassing as it was for you to have an accident at your age, the extra absorbency did prevent things from getting even more harrowing.

	However, now you had to just stand there, the warmth spreading across your underwear, the blush on your cheeks getting deeper and deeper. You hadn&#39;t thought this far ahead...what did you do now? Surely Emily wouldn&#39;t leave you this way...but she did look awfully frustrated with you.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

She&#39;d transformed you into a toddler because she was fed up with your behaviour and wanted you to learn a lesson.

Now you were getting a //very// keen lesson on that fact. Emily would have done almost the entire task for you, if you&#39;d asked. She even would have turned you back to normal before this happened if you said one little silly phrase. Instead you had to be stubborn, so she wanted to make sure the lesson was driven home.

So you had to stand there &lt;&lt;if $emilyLowHappinessDiaper&gt;&gt;in an increasingly uncomfortable wet diaper.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;in increasingly uncomfortable wet undies&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.

	It was enough, for now. She nodded, waving her wand in your direction. There was a blinding flash of light.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	You folded your arms back at her. Turning your head away from her with a &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;humph.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You still weren&#39;t going to give her the satisfaction.

	She looked like she was about to strangle you. Her wand lifted, pointing at you, a dark look crossing her eyes. But before she could do anything there was a blinding flash of light.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

With that Emily walked back to join the other girls. As annoyed as she was it was clear that your behaviour hadn&#39;t endeared you to the others either. Seeing you that way was just kinda gross. As cute as a toddler was in the abstract, they didn&#39;t want to deal with any of the yucky realities that came with it. 

You still felt shaken from the experience. You felt mostly restored, but some of the feelings were hanging on. How @@.girlVoice;small@@ and @@.girlVoice;helpless@@ you&#39;d been. That @@.girlVoice;weakness@@ still suffused your body, but no choice but to get back to the party...after a quick bathroom trip.

@@.momVoice;&quot;Very serious, something important came up and it simply cannot wait until tomorrow.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;But-\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

@@.momVoice;&quot;No buts mister, with the way you&#39;ve been acting lately you&#39;re lucky that this is all you have to do.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;You can&#39;t blame me for that. Emily has been such a pain.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Your mother sighed, @@.momVoice;&quot;You forget how similar you were at that age. Emily is eight, you&#39;re going to have to be patient. You&#39;re going to have to be patient with all of them.&quot;@@ She fixed you with a look that solidified that this wasn&#39;t a debate. 

@@.momVoice;&quot;You&#39;re going to keep the girls company for the night and make sure that they have fun. When I return I expect them to tell me you were a delight and made the sleepover a huge success.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Do I really have to be here the whole night? Watching a bunch of stupid little girls?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

@@.momVoice;&quot;The whole night, you&#39;d better not leave them alone.&quot;@@ She checked her watch and clicked her tongue, @@.momVoice;&quot;I must go, or I&#39;m going to be late. You behave yourself, I&#39;ve given your sister a wand just in case you won&#39;t play along. Have fun.&quot;@@ 

[[A wand...|Opening Passage 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1101" name="Opening Passage 2" tags="" position="100,13850" size="100,100">Fantastic, so your sister was going to have unknown magic on her side. It was probably worth noting at this point that your mother was a witch, and you meant that in a very literal sense. You didn&#39;t have all the details, but you&#39;d seen her do enough that you couldn&#39;t possibly doubt it.

Physical transformations into animals, closets that made everything fit, teleportation, mental manipulations making you talk like a baby. She said there were limitations, but to you it seemed almost limitless.

Apparently your sister had the gift as well, but you didn&#39;t know where she sat in that power scale. Last time she&#39;d demonstrated those powers you&#39;d ended up with rabbit ears and an irresistible craving for carrots. With a wand empowered by your mother she might be capable of a lot more.

You on the other hand didn&#39;t have any talent for it at all, and nor would you ever. Apparently magic was a &#39;no boys allowed&#39; kind of thing. Which meant you were going to have no way of defending yourself from...whatever your mom and her had planned.

Great. An entire night spent watching over a gaggle of annoying little girls, without being allowed to leave. Bad enough if it didn&#39;t also come with a doubly annoying sister armed with a magic wand.

[[Demand an explanation|Opening Passage 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1102" name="Opening Passage 3" tags="" position="225,13850" size="100,100">@@.momVoice;&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t have to do anything too strenuous. Almost everything has been taken care of. All of the activities are planned, snacks are ready and dinner has been ordered.&quot;@@

It wasn&#39;t the workload that annoyed you, it was the fact you were getting stuck with a bunch of annoying giggly girls. Your sister was //probably// the worst, but the rest would just amplify her annoyances. 

She turned again to leave, @@.momVoice;&quot;if anything serious happens Emily knows how to signal me with her wand and you know my number.&quot;@@

It was a stronger statement than it appeared. You knew your mother could literally be back at a moment&#39;s notice, you&#39;d seen her teleport across town before. Though apparently she could only come back to the house. So she&#39;d still have to abandon...whatever it was she was doing. Best to avoid it, but at least you had a safety net.

She gave a small smile, @@.momVoice;&quot;just let yourself relax and have some fun. Maybe you&#39;ll find yourself enjoying it more than you expect.&quot;@@

You weren&#39;t sure how you could ever have fun at a bunch of childish games, but your mother seemed oddly confident.

@@.momVoice;&quot;You will try to enjoy yourself won&#39;t you?&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;You gave her a goddamn magic wand, you&#39;re basically //telling// her to mess with me.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Your mother stayed silent as you continued your lecture.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;She&#39;s going to turn me into a rabbit or a baby or some random shit and then what? How am I supposed to take care of them when that happens?\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

@@.momVoice;&quot;Well you don&#39;t really need to take care of much.&quot;@@

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;That is so not the point...if you want an empowered bratty child witch, then //you// can deal with the consequences.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

With that you walked out the door yourself, leaving a shocked mom in your wake. You tensed, waiting for the consequences of your actions. Yet nothing seemed to occur. Perhaps you&#39;d shocked her enough that you&#39;d gotten away with it, or maybe she was impressed enough that you&#39;d stood up to her that she let you off with it. 

Either way you weren&#39;t sticking around. Hurrying away until you were out of eyeshot before breathing a sigh of relief. No doubt you were going to feel the consequences of this eventually, but for today you needed somewhere to crash. Billy&#39;s house wasn&#39;t far, and he&#39;d probably let you stay the night.

You laughed to yourself, seemed like you&#39;d be spending the night at a sleepover after all, but this one would be mundane. No magic, no transformations, no insane witch of a mother or bratty witch of a sister. It sounded like heaven.

You looked grimly at the quartet of girls before you, your charges until tomorrow morning. You&#39;d met them all before, so you had some sense of what you were dealing with. 

Though to help your mom had provided you with a minor magical item of your own. You fiddled with the mood ring on your finger, the gem in the center glowing different colors as you pointed it to each girl in turn. It let you know approximately how each of them felt about you. So you already knew that Sophie and Emily hated you, while Miki and Kara had no strong feelings.

It was a 2/3 split but she was clever enough that she spent basically all her time doing grade 3 work. Her long mousy brown hair looked a little dishevelled and somehow her glasses had been knocked askew. But she didn&#39;t seem to mind any of that.

@@.sophieVoice;Sophie@@ was the oldest of the girls. As such, she&#39;d taken on a bit of an older sister role. Curly red hair framed a freckled face that seemed to have a permanent dirt smudge. It wouldn&#39;t be right to call her a tomboy, but she was a little more rough and tumble than the rest. She was also surprisingly physically capable for her age, though at nine it wasn&#39;t a high bar.

@@.mikiVoice;Miki@@ was, by contrast, the youngest of the girls. She was the younger sister of a boy from Emily&#39;s class. Apparently they&#39;d hit it off far better than Emily and the boy. Her black hair was pulled into two loose pigtails that bounced whenever she moved. As far as you&#39;d seen she was pretty shy, but certain things could get her very excited.

@@.emilyVoice;Emily@@, your sister, was the most vocal of the group. Which meant that a lot of their plans ended up coming from her. You found her massively annoying, it felt like half the time she was acting more like a toddler than an eight year old. Her wavy blond hair and rosy cheeks gave her just the perfect look to get away with murder. She knew this, and she used it. You couldn&#39;t count the number of times her annoying giggle had gotten her out of trouble.

It was clear they&#39;d already been briefed on the situation so there was no reason to belabour that point.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;So I&#39;ll be over on the couch watching TV. You all behave yourself and if you desperately need something you know where I am.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Mom had said you needed to &#39;keep them company&#39;, you could tolerate that. You were less enthused by the idea of playing along with them. So you&#39;d avoid it if you could.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Mommy said you would play with us...&quot;@@ Emily seemed disappointed by your words. Idly she toyed with the wand. A nervous tick or a reminder of the power she had? You couldn&#39;t say.

She perked back up quickly, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;but since I&#39;m super nice I&#39;ll even let you pick what we do. Mommy left a list. It&#39;s in here.&quot;@@

Emily handed you a leather bound journal. Opening it showed the list that Emily had referred to. Apparently your mother hadn&#39;t been kidding about preparing things. A glance at the list showed a litany of @@.girlVoice;childish@@ and @@.girlVoice;girly@@ activities. Perhaps some were tolerable, but others looked deeply unpleasant. Still, you&#39;d have to at least pick something for them to do, whether you participated or not.

You took a moment to jot down a few of your initial thoughts. Keep yourself a little &#39;apocalypse log&#39; so you&#39;d be able to make sense of everything that was about to happen. You didn&#39;t know exactly what Emily had planned, but she had a wand, so you doubted you&#39;d come out of things unscathed. Maybe this time you&#39;d at least avoid getting turned into a rabbit.

The end of the book had a number of blank pages which felt like they were just waiting for content. Perhaps you&#39;d find some things to fill them as time went on.

You were about to close the book when you noticed one of those &#39;blank&#39; pages had something on it. 

//My report card?//

It was an extremely strange thing to find in a journal, but right now it looked normal enough. You&#39;d have to keep an eye on it, as well as for anything else showing up. But before anything else could happen you were going to need to pick an activity.

You weren&#39;t a boy anymore, that particular &#39;battle&#39; was already lost. Which meant from now on you were just going to keep getting younger and younger.  You didn&#39;t actually know how far this would go. If the idea was to have you fit into the party then surely they wouldn&#39;t make you too young, right? A toddler wouldn&#39;t fit in. At least you hoped so. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt; 10&gt;&gt;You were already younger than you wanted, you didn&#39;t need this to go further. You had to do whatever you could to stop this continued regression.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You were okay will being this age, or even a @@.girlVoice;little younger@@, so maybe losing another year or two wouldn&#39;t be too bad. But that didn&#39;t mean you&#39;d be okay with turning into a toddler.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You were going to have to fight to remain in the form you wanted. Although...you took a look at your arms...maybe &#39;fight&#39; wasn&#39;t the right word. Any muscles you&#39;d once had were entirely gone now. Until now you&#39;d at least been holding onto a vestige of them, it at least looked like your arms could lift something. Now they were @@.girlVoice;delicate@@ little twigs. The skin was so @@.girlVoice;smooth and soft@@ it looked like you&#39;d never done any labour in your life.

A fact that Sophie seemed to have picked up upon. She came over to you as you continued to reminisce about your lost strength, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;How you doing there shorty?&quot;@@

You wanted to snap back at her for that comment, but you realized something, she wasn&#39;t wrong. It must have happened recently, but she was taller than you now. It wasn&#39;t much, no more than an inch, but it was enough to be noticeable. You&#39;d just lost your status as a boy, and now you&#39;d lost your status as the biggest as well. You&#39;d never really considered Sophie to be some physical powerhouse, her boasts of her athletic prowess had always sounded quaint compared to what you had been capable of. But looking at her now, an inch taller and a few pounds heavier than you, she cut a much more impressive figure.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;You know I&#39;ve been wondering, which of us is stronger.&quot;@@ Sophie drawled, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;I&#39;d meant to find out earlier, but then Emily was talking about how you looked like your mommy, and then we found out you were a girl...so I didn&#39;t get a chance.

As you clasped Sophie&#39;s hand you were struck by several facts at once: One, her hand was a little rougher than you&#39;d expected, while your own were @@.girlVoice;baby soft@@ with @@.girlVoice;slender, delicate@@ fingers. Two, her hand was the same size as yours. Before you could have fit your whole hand around hers if she made a fist. Three, her grip was concerningly powerful. Maybe she was just trying to get a good grip, or maybe she was trying to intimidate you. Either way when you tried to squeeze back to counteract the pressure...it didn&#39;t do anything. She didn&#39;t even seem to register that you&#39;d tried. You just had to hope your arm strength would be up to the task.

But a @@.girlVoice;pretty voice@@ was a very minor point in comparision. Storming into the bathroom you slammed the door behind you, or at least tried to. The totality of your strength wasn&#39;t enough to get a &#39;slam&#39;, just a regular &#39;thud&#39;.

Being a @@.girlVoice;weakling@@ sucked, but there was something else that had your attention. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 10&gt;&gt;You breathed a sigh of relief.

You didn&#39;t need to drop anything to know what had happened.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;In truth, you were still hoping that maybe you were misreading the situation, that you weren&#39;t feeling what you were feeling. But you couldn&#39;t deny that your new @@.girlVoice;panties@@ were feeling nice and snug. You&#39;d known this was coming, but it didn&#39;t make it any easier now that it was here.

The intensity of her green eyes was @@.girlVoice;surprisingly intimidating@@. After all, you&#39;d never seen it at eye level before. 

She put her hand on top of her head before sliding it over towards you, gently brushing the top of your scalp.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;Darn,&quot;@@ she cursed, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;so close,&quot;@@ she backed away slightly. @@.sophieVoice;&quot;I guess you&#39;re still the &#39;big girl&#39; in the group...for now.&quot;@@

You started, had you really gotten //that// short? But it was true, you had no more than an inch on Sophie, you two were @@.girlVoice;practically the same size@@. That&#39;s why she&#39;d been so disappointed about the comparison, she thought she&#39;d already been the &#39;big girl&#39;.

&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 11&gt;&gt;\
Though it was a dubious honour, you didn&#39;t want to be the &#39;big girl&#39;, you&#39;d almost preferred when you looked like a &#39;woman&#39;. There was little left on you that gave any indication of maturity. If it weren&#39;t for the little bumps under your nipples you&#39;d inarguably be considered a child. You&#39;d lost the battle for your manhood, but you could still fight for your adulthood, the little that was left.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
You were really unsure how to feel about that. You&#39;d come to terms with being a girl, but being the &#39;big girl&#39; was something else entirely. You&#39;d gotten along with the other girls better and better the smaller you&#39;d gotten. Maybe it would be even easier if you were just &#39;one of the girls&#39; and Sophie was the biggest. Then again there was pride in being the &#39;big girl&#39;, it meant they would all have to look up to you and respect you. In the end, it might not be your choice anyway. If you lost another year...well, you&#39;d have to see what happened.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

You glanced over at your &lt;&lt;if $traitLittleSister || $traitBabySister&gt;&gt;&quot;big&quot; sister&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;little sister&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;, only to realize you only had a couple inches on her as well. &lt;&lt;if $traitLittleSister || $traitBabySister&gt;&gt;She&#39;d been your undisputed @@.girlVoice;big sister@@ soon enough. Though it wouldn&#39;t change much for you, she was still your @@.girlVoice;big sis@@ even if she was a little shorter.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;She wasn&#39;t so &#39;little&#39; anymore. It might be wise to drop that part of her label. At this rate she&#39;d be turning it around on you soon enough.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Either way it was clear that the girls had become a lot more comfortable with you. Who knew what kind of activities they might have in store now?

Passing by the full-length mirror you stopped to take a look. What you saw was either a mercy or a terror depending on your perspective. On the one hand, it seemed that your changes were slowing down. As you headed back through puberty the changes weren&#39;t going to be as drastic. 

Your tits were getting smaller, &lt;&lt;if $traitChubby || $traitFat&gt;&gt;down to barely a b-cup&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;now barely even an a-cup&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;. But you couldn&#39;t decide how you felt about it. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;=8&gt;&gt;Did you want to keep being a @@.girlVoice;big girl@@ with tits? Or did you want to just be a @@.girlVoice;little girl@@ like the others?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Did you want to keep the one sign of your maturity? Or did you want them to shrink away and stop looking so feminine?&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Though looking less feminine came with one unexpected consequence, You were becoming more androgynous. The bodies of prepubescent boys and girls were actually fairly similar. Most of the differences came from other signals. Their hair, wardrobe choices, color choices. Everyone knew that blue was for boys and @@.girlVoice;pink@@ was for girls. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 10 || $traitFashionista&gt;&gt;As a result your outfit had a secondary purpose. It was so @@.girlVoice;girly@@ that no one would ever mistake you for a boy.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;If you could get back into a set of boy clothes you might even be able to pass as a boy again.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Passing for a boy...not a man...you stared at your reflection. Was there anything left of you that was manly? It&#39;d been a while since you&#39;d been truly hairy, but you&#39;d still had peach fuzz. Now you were hairless save for your head. Any remnant of your hard-earned six-pack was gone, you hadn&#39;t even noticed it fading, everything else going on had stolen your attention. 

However, there was one strange feeling that you couldn&#39;t identify. Your mouth felt, for lack of a better term, less full. Staring at your smooth, soft face you opened your mouth wide. A closer inspection showed that a few of your molars had disappeared. You didn&#39;t know where they had gone, but it seemed you weren&#39;t old enough to have them any more. You were dangerously close to crossing the line between man and boy...or maybe you already had.

Though that wasn&#39;t the only line you were about to cross. You adjusted your underwear just to confirm. You were still male, but that might change at any moment.

You wanted to deny it and shoo her away, but she was basically correct. Your hair was getting lighter, now a dirty blond.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;We&#39;ll play dressup again soon. Okay?&quot;@@ She didn&#39;t wait for an answer. But she didn&#39;t need one. If you kept shrinking you&#39;d need a new outfit soon, whether you wanted to or not.

It was becoming increasingly difficult to recognize yourself in the face that stared back at you. You&#39;d come so far from when you&#39;d started this party, as the babysitter.

It was hard to look at this almost girl and say she was old enough to babysit anyone, let alone a whole party. Sophie would no doubt be challenging you more and more, considering how close you were in size. It was easy enough to tell her what to do when you had a couple feet on her. Far more difficult when you only had a few inches. You stretched out on your tip toes, trying to give yourself more height, but it just made you look ridiculous. 

You shook your head, it&#39;d be fine.

Your mind cast back to your mother&#39;s words before she left, &quot;keep the girls company&quot;, &quot;relax and have some fun&quot;. She&#39;d never told you to &quot;take care of them&quot; or &quot;get them to bed on time&quot; or anything you&#39;d expect an actual babysitter to do, because she didn&#39;t expect you to. Sometimes your mom was distressingly clever. She&#39;d assumed that you&#39;d get regressed like this and no longer be able to fulfil the role of babysitter.

&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 10&gt;&gt;You breathed a sigh of relief. That meant you didn&#39;t need to worry at all, you could @@.girlVoice;just have fun@@ and everything would be fine.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You huffed out a breath and tried to relax. It did take some pressure off, you were basically free of any lingering responsibilities. You could join in or stay apart at your own impetus and your mother wouldn&#39;t be mad.

The other girls looked taken aback by the suggestion. Clearly they had been looking forward to dress up time and you were threatening to ruin it. But Emily had things well in hand, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;Yup! Just has to sit in there for a couple days to absorb the magic.&quot;@@

Whether that was crap she was making up, or legitimate you couldn&#39;t say. But either way she wasn&#39;t letting you use that as an out.

She finished pulling out a few more outfits before she was satisfied. @@.emilyVoice;&quot;Which one do you want to try on first?&quot;@@ &lt;&lt;if $traitChubby || $traitFat&gt;&gt;Before you could pick, Emily leaned in close and whispered so only you could hear. @@.emilyVoice;&quot;Don&#39;t worry.

It was odd, you weren&#39;t sure you&#39;d seen her wear //any// of them. Hmmm, relatives kept getting her &#39;mature&#39; clothes for celebrations. But she still preferred things that much more playful. These must be the unused &#39;mature&#39; clothes.

Despite this supposed maturity there was another clear theme, @@.girlVoice;pink@@ and @@.girlVoice;girly@@. Not that you were surprised, if your sister was getting the chance to dress up her &#39;big brother&#39;, she was going to go all in. At least you had a bunch of&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 12&gt;&gt;@@.girlVoice; cute@@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; choices, you&#39;d surely be able to find something you liked. 

&lt;&lt;if $traitImaginaryFriend &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;\
	$imaginaryFriendName was practically dancing in glee, @@.imaginaryFriendVoice;&quot;Dress-up, dress-up, we get to play dress-up! You are going to look so much cuter!&quot;@@

	You certainly couldn&#39;t deny her. Getting something from Emily&#39;s closet that fit better would assuredly be @@.girlVoice;cuter@@. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt; 12 || !$traitFashionista&gt;&gt;Everyone else would just ignore the fact that //you// didn&#39;t want to be cuter.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
The first was a combination of a @@.girlVoice;pink@@ t-shirt with short jean shorts. No guy would ever be caught dead in shorts that short, especially not jean shorts. That wasn&#39;t even getting into the&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 12&gt;&gt; @@.girlVoice; adorable@@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; red tassel hanging off the waistband as an accent.

The second was an exotic looking dress. You&#39;d seen this kind of dress before, though you had no idea what it was called. It was the brightest pink of the bunch&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 9&gt;&gt;, @@.girlVoice;which automatically made it amazing&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;. The whole thing was also covered in a floral pattern, as if it wasn&#39;t @@.girlVoice;girly@@ enough. The hem of the dress stopped just after your knee, but the slit came up high on your thigh, so you&#39;d still be able to move freely. It wasn&#39;t like it was showing off more leg than the other choices, but the slit felt more &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 12&gt;&gt;@@.girlVoice;girly@@&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;flirty&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; than the others. &lt;&lt;if $traitCatgirl&gt;&gt;@@.karaVoice;&quot;You should pick this one!&quot;@@ Kara yelped, @@.karaVoice;&quot;you&#39;ll look just like Ran Mao!&quot;@@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

The third was a white t-shirt and ripped capri jeans. One could argue that this was the least girly of the options, simply because it was the only one that wasn&#39;t pink. Except it had a big &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 12&gt;&gt;@@.girlVoice; cute@@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; red polka dot heart on the chest and a&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 12&gt;&gt;n @@.girlVoice;even cuter@@&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; matching&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; heart on the pants.

The fourth was a combination of another pink t-shirt and a black knee length skirt. It took you a few moments to figure this one out. The skirt was damn near transparent. The trick was that the shirt was long enough that it acted as a minidress on its own. So you got the niceness of a light and airy skirt without showing off anything untoward. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;=12&gt;&gt;@@.girlVoice;It would be so much fun to twirl in this.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; The text on this one was a bit of a contradiction for you. &#39;DON&#39;T FEEL SMALL&#39;.

The last one you at least knew what you were looking at. It was a simple enough sleeveless dress with a hem just above your knee. True it was less pink than some of the others, but the&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 12&gt;&gt;@@.girlVoice; pretty@@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; butterflies more than made up for it. It would certainly make you feel awfully &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 12&gt;&gt;@@.girlVoice;beautiful@@ and @@.girlVoice;girly@@&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;feminine&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.

Closing the bathroom door you let yourself relax, loosening the death grip on your clothes. Naturally this resulted in your &lt;&lt;if getCurrentOutfit().bottom === &#39;dress&#39;&gt;&gt;underwear&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;getCurrentOutfit().bottom&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; sliding off and pooling at the ground by your feet. You stepped out of the pile and put your new outfit to the side. Finally you slipped out of your shirt, leaving you bare before the mirror. 

This meant you were able to get a better look at yourself. Though in truth it was pretty awkward to even look at yourself in this form. You didn&#39;t recognize it as your own body, so it felt almost like you were peeping on someone else. 

&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 9 &amp;&amp; $playerMaturity &lt; 13 || $traitFashionista&gt;&gt;\
	It was hard to be sure but it seemed like your breasts had shrunk a little bit. On the one hand this vaguely annoyed you. Having a chest differentiated you from the other girls, who were clearly still children. Then again they had been super annoying, without a bra they kept annoyingly @@.girlVoice;bouncing@@ everywhere. They were still big enough for that to be an annoyance, maybe you should ask for a bra?

	Well there was one other thing that separated you from the //girls//, but you really didn&#39;t want to think about that. You looked almost totally like a teenage girl, once you got your clothes back on there way no way anyone would be able to tell the difference. Admittedly you @@.girlVoice;kinda liked@@ how you looked, sure it was way different than how you had before, but it felt like it @@.girlVoice;suited you better@@.

	As a bonus you bet you&#39;d look even better once you got that @@.girlVoice;cute@@ outfit on. Heck, a little @@.girlVoice;makeup@@ might cover up those few blemishes you had. You&#39;d be able to show it off to all the girls and you bet the boys at school would...you flushed, cutting off that thought before it went any further.&lt;&lt;if $sexualityLock&gt;&gt;It felt weird to think that a boy might think of you //that// way.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You shouldn&#39;t be worried about what the @@.girlVoice;cute@@ boys at school would think.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; No matter how @@.girlVoice;pretty@@ you looked you weren&#39;t about to go showing off that fact.

	Of course you actually had to put the outfit on before you could get a proper look. Emily had been nice enough to provide a new set of underwear. &lt;&lt;if $playerUnderwear === &quot;panties&quot;&gt;&gt;Your current set had gotten too big. Slipping them on you found them to be much more comfortable than before.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Naturally you&#39;d never worn panties before, but the thought of them didn&#39;t particularly bother you. Slipping them on you found them to be much more comfortable than your $playerUnderwear.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;  They weren&#39;t //quite// right yet, but still major improvement. No doubt they&#39;d be a perfect fit for you soon enough, or moreso you&#39;d be a perfect fit for them.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 13&gt;&gt;\
	On the positive side some of your more obvious feminine traits were declining. You were thrilled that you wouldn&#39;t have to be carrying around those annoying @@.girlVoice;bouncy bits@@. However, all of this was tinged with the negative implication. The changes weren&#39;t happening because you were turning back into a guy, they were happening because you were becoming a prepubescent child.

	You were still a guy though, at least for the moment. Though once you got yourself dressed up you doubted anyone would be able to tell. Despite the fact you were losing those feminine curves you looked even more like a girl than before. All the hard edges on you had been softened, everything was increasingly small and delicate.

	But all of this consideration was just a delay tactic. You cast your eyes back to the outfit you&#39;d been coerced into trying on. There wasn&#39;t a choice, you needed to put on something.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $playerUnderwear === &quot;panties&quot;&gt;&gt;\
		Emily had given you a new set of @@.girlVoice;panties@@. You still weren&#39;t thrilled about the idea of having to wear them, but it wasn&#39;t like you hadn&#39;t been wearing them before. These ones would at least fit right. Even if you would much rather get your $playerUnderwear back.

		Getting them on you glanced at the mirror and came to two sudden revelations.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		First you had to deal with one particularly painful item...

		You gingerly picked up the panties, holding them up with two fingers, as if they might burn you...

		Gritting your teeth you hurriedly slipped them over your legs and pulled them up. Settling them into place you were struck with two awful realizations. 

		One, they didn&#39;t look at all out of place on you. Your reflection was, in a very strange sense of the word, normal. Two, and perhaps more distressing. They fit shockingly well. There was a slight bit of discomfort, but it was only slight. Overall they were basically perfect for you, or at least would be soon.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	What you saw in the mirror was a mixed bag. You didn&#39;t look like a @@.girlVoice;gross boy@@ anymore, but you also didn&#39;t look like you wanted to. You were a @@.girlVoice;big girl@@ and you weren&#39;t sure you wanted to be. Having @@.girlVoice;boobies@@ was weird, and they were uncomfortable. You hoped they&#39;d get smaller soon.

	Of course there was a part of you that wanted to be a big girl, but it made you too different from the rest of the girls. Why couldn&#39;t you look more like Emily? You wished you had @@.girlVoice;pretty blonde@@ hair like her, rather than your boring brown. Not that brown was bad, Kara had brown hair and hers was @@.girlVoice;pretty@@ too, if a bit messy. Your eyes had gotten a little lighter as well and sparkled in a way they hadn&#39;t before. That @@.girlVoice;delighted@@ you and you wondered if it would continue.

	And you //knew// that you&#39;d feel much better about everything once you got into that @@.girlVoice;cute@@ outfit. It was actually a @@.girlVoice;little less cute than you&#39;d hoped for@@, but much better than @@.girlVoice;boring boy clothes@@.

	Emily had even given you new underwear which you hurriedly put on. There were parts of you that you shouldn&#39;t be looking at, even if it was attached to you it made you feel dirty too look at. These fit much better and were @@.girlVoice;much cuter@@ than your old $playerUnderwear. You couldn&#39;t believe you used to wear baggy, scratchy clothes like that.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

[[Examine yourself further|Dressup Age 12 2b]]

It was still you, there were touches on your face that confirmed that, but no part of you had been spared the changes.

Your hard-won muscles had faded. You looked stronger than your average twelve year old girl, but not by much. Even flexing you were only able to get modest definition.\
&lt;&lt;if $traitChubby&gt;&gt;\
It didn&#39;t help that all those muscles had a little bit of extra fat covering them, though your limbs had been spared the brunt of your newfound @@.girlVoice;chubbiness@@. Your torso seemed to have gotten the majority of your extra pounds. Obviously there was your @@.girlVoice;plump@@ stomach which hung just over your underwear. It had blunted the appearance of your shrinking waist, but the extra fat on your hips ensured that you still had an undeniably feminine body shape.

There was also the matter of your ass being bigger and @@.girlVoice;jigglier@@ than you would have expected at this size. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 11&gt;&gt;It was something you could appreciate on a girl, but now that it was on you it only made you self concious. You were still young enough that it held pert, &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 13&gt;&gt;but you weren&#39;t sure how to feel about that. You didn&#39;t want a &#39;nice butt&#39;, not like this.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;which was a mercy. A saggy butt would have been mortifying.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You knew girls at this age had bigger butts than boys, but you didn&#39;t really want one. There was a vague discomfort that everything should just be smaller.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Your cheeks were the last obvious change. In terms of scale it wasn&#39;t much, but it changed the character of your face, giving it a pleasant roundness. It was indicative of how the rest of you looked. Even if someone could only see your face they&#39;d know instinctively about your stomach.

Surprisingly seeing yourself like this actually made you feel slightly better about it. It still made you uncomfortable, but not as awful as it had before.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
The change made you look even slimmer than you would be otherwise. Bulking up always made you gain a little fat as well, unless you were supremely disciplined. That fat had vanished along with the muscle, now you were just plain skinny. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 13&gt;&gt;You didn&#39;t like how @@.girlVoice;delicate@@ it made you look.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Which you much preferred, who wanted to be &#39;bulky&#39;?&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; It was almost ironic; your stomach was finally trim enough to show off your abs, except you had no abs to show.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

You&#39;d also become a lot less hairy. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;=13&gt;&gt;This was one of the few changes you could actually tolerate, you&#39;d never been too attached to your body hair in the first place.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;This might be your favourite change so far. Being that hairy was @@.girlVoice;super gross@@.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

But that was enough staring at yourself, the girls might start wondering if something had gone wrong. Time to get dressed.

Finished, you took a deep breath and took one last look at yourself in the mirror. &lt;&lt;if $traitFourEyes&gt;&gt;Then you realized you @@.blurry-text2;couldn&#39;t actually see properly@@.

That&#39;s a lie, they would, you&#39;d turn some heads in this outfit.

This however forced the realization that you looked solidly like a middle schooler now. Hell, you weren&#39;t even a teenager anymore, having regressed all the way back to a tween. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 8&gt;&gt;That still felt @@.girlVoice;awfully old@@, you @@.girlVoice;didn&#39;t feel that grown up@@ at all.

It wasn&#39;t like twelve was all that different than thirteen in an absolute sense, but it felt like a threshold had been unwillingly crossed.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Nervously you took hold of the bathroom door. What were the girls going to think of this? You shouldn&#39;t care about what a bunch of little girls thought about your outfit.

Before you were able to exit the room Emily suddenly shouted.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Wait! We need to do one more thing!&quot;@@

You stopped in the doorway, turning back to see what had drawn Emily&#39;s attention. She was standing in front of a growth chart. Your mother had gotten it when Emily was three and measured her again every year.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Everyone come over here!&quot;@@ Emily gestured to the group and you all dutifully obeyed. Over the next few moments she measured the three other girls and put their names on the chart. Things were a little cramped, Miki and Kara were about the same height Emily was at their age, but it was clear enough.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Your turn,&quot;@@ she pointed at you. You took your place in front of the chart. Emily handed the pen to Sophie and she made a mark for your new height and age.

&lt;/div&gt;\
@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Oh, and we&#39;ll need this.&quot;@@ With a wave of her wand one additional mark appeared. &quot;John - Age 16&quot;. Almost a full foot above your current height.

&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 10&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	Looking at the mark was disconcerting. Seeing how dramatically far you&#39;d fallen in such a short time. You were still taller than the other girls, but it was getting close. You didn&#39;t even have half a foot on Sophie.

	The worst part though was the big number 5 //above// your mark. It was a troubling threshold to have crossed. As a teenager being under five foot would be a serious source of derision for any guy. But you @@.girlVoice;weren&#39;t a teen@@ anymore, and you were @@.girlVoice;barely a guy@@.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

I got to play dress up with the girls! It was alot of fun and my out fit is much cuter now. Before I was too big and too boy to be able to dress up. Emilys closet was magikal and made her little clothes into big clothes for me she said it could not do boy clothes. but thats okay boy clothes are gross. I want to dress up in more cute cloths.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &lt;= 13&gt;&gt;\
They dressed me up in girl clothes! I totally wasn&#39;t sure about it at first. I mean obviously my old clothes didn&#39;t fit. I&#39;m like two feet shorter now and probably weigh like half, a quarter, or something its some math thing to do with squares and cubes, I don&#39;t remember. Whatever, I got dressed up, and it was all *super* girly, cause Emily was pulling it from her closet, and she&#39;s eight so @@.strikethrough;it&#39;s@@ its made for little kids, but the closet was magic so it fit me anyway, oh but my boy stuff &#39;wouldn&#39;t work&#39; for some dumb reason, it was totes wierd.

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
Well I officially look like one of them. I&#39;ve shrunken enough that my clothes didn&#39;t fit, and they took it upon themselves to get me dressed in something new and &#39;cute&#39;. In the end I got stuck in a &lt;&lt;print getCurrentOutfit().name&gt;&gt;. Couldn&#39;t even claim that &#39;hairy legs won&#39;t look right&#39; as pretty much all my body hair is gone. No one going to ever doubt I&#39;m a girl in this outfit. Thanks to Emily&#39;s magic closet it fits perfectly, so no more worries about my pants falling down. &lt;&lt;if getCurrentOutfit().bottom === &#39;skirt&#39; || getCurrentOutfit().bottom === &#39;dress&#39;&gt;&gt;Now I just have to worry about people peeking under my skirt. God that felt weird to even write, but doesn&#39;t make it less true.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Now I just have to deal with endless compliments about how &#39;cute&#39; I am. I&#39;m a guy.

The constant pressure on your chest. A strange shifting weight. Your blocked view when you looked down. You had breasts, proper undeniable breasts. Despite the fact you were getting younger, it seemed that you were still well into puberty. Did that make you an early bloomer? The implications of all of this were enough to make your head hurt.

The other girls hadn&#39;t said anything, but it was pretty obvious that they&#39;d noticed. Miki and Kara were looking on with something approaching awe, Emily had a fox-like grin and Sophie looked annoyed. You turned red, you didn&#39;t care what their reactions were, you didn&#39;t want &#39;&#39;anyone&#39;&#39; seeing this.

You hurried over to the mirror to get a better sense of the changes. Breasts were one thing, but you had a feeling there was going to be more than that. Even walking over you could feel that several of your body parts had &#39;progressed&#39;.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;What is&quot;&gt;&gt; @@.playerVoice6;going on&quot;@@. You coughed, trying to clear your throat, a touch of your neck revealing the lack of an obvious Adam&#39;s apple. A consideration for later, you had larger concerns. First and foremost being the pair of orbs attached to your chest. The weight was a constant reminder of their presence. You also weren&#39;t thrilled to note that you had a growing ass to go along with it. Gingerly you reached back to lift your new protrusion. 

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Heavy...\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;, you mumbled to yourself. You let your hands run to your hips &lt;&lt;if $playerOutfit === 0&gt;&gt;which were threatening to burst out of the jeans&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;now noticeably wider than your waist&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;. &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 12 || ($playerMaturity &gt;= 9 || $sexualLock)&gt;&gt;If it had been a different situation you might have thought the @@.girlVoice;girl@@ in the mirror was pretty &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 14&gt;&gt;hot&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;cute&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.

Your voice had started cracking. It was like you were going through puberty again, except your voice had never been that high.

Emily giggled at your struggles, and Miki walked over to examine the situation, @@.mikiVoice;&quot;you look so pretty.&quot;@@ 

You opened your mouth to comment, but thought better of it. For one you didn&#39;t want to deal with that @@.girlVoice;cracking voice@@, but also you couldn&#39;t entirely disagree. Your acne had almost entirely cleaned up and your hair looked healthier and brighter than ever.

Which wasn&#39;t to say you looked entirely like a girl. Sure your arms and legs were mostly hairless, &lt;&lt;if $traitFat&gt;&gt;but they still had good muscle. Not that you could see much under your excess weight.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;but they still had more bulk than you&#39;d ever seen on a teenage girl.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Plus your face was still decently rugged. If you checked the finer details about you, you were fairly androgynous. But most people wouldn&#39;t look that deeply and your body shape was undeniably feminine.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Can we be done with this&quot;&gt;&gt; @@.playerVoice7;now?@@&quot; Damn, you&#39;d almost kept your voice steady there.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Nuh uh, we don&#39;t want a babysitter, we want a new playmate.&quot;@@

You rolled your eyes, you weren&#39;t going to get out of this one. Walking back to the rest of the group you tried to ignore all of the strange new sensations. Things @@.girlVoice;bouncing@@ and @@.girlVoice;jiggling@@, you understood now why girls needed bras, &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 14&gt;&gt;but there was no way in hell you were asking for one.

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
I&#39;m convinced that I&#39;m becoming a girl faster than I&#39;m becoming a child. I almost entirely look like a girl now, I&#39;ve even got actual breasts now. Apparently I&#39;m an &#39;early bloomer&#39;. It&#39;s hard to say if they&#39;ll get even bigger, or my increasing youth will shrink them back down.

Standing still everything was fine, but when you started walking again something was clearly different. It didn&#39;t feel wrong per say, just different.

You scratched at your chest, wincing at the contact. How was your chest still this sensitive? Discomforted you made your way over to the mirror, trying to walk with what you thought was your usual stride. However, that just felt wrong and uncomfortable, so you just let your hips and legs do whatever they wanted.

&lt;&lt;if $playerOutfit === 0&gt;&gt;\
Looking in the mirror quickly revealed the source of at least one of your problems. Your pants didn&#39;t fit, thought not quite in the way you expected. They were too long, but that was to be expected. You were almost half a foot shorter than at the start of the day.

What you didn&#39;t expect was that it was too tight around your hips and more embarrassingly, your ass. For a moment this tripped you up, if you were getting younger shouldn&#39;t everything be getting smaller. But you weren&#39;t just getting younger. After all, no //male// teenager had hips like this.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
Looking in the mirror it took you a few moments to figure out what going on. Your new outfit fit a lot differently, and it obscured what you&#39;d normally look for. Though the new outfit had nothing to do with the fact you were a lot lower in the mirror than you had been before. You were almost half a foot shorter than at the start of the day.

Finally you realized the source of your discomfort walking, your hips and ass were a lot bigger than they were supposed to be. It forced you to walk with a little more sway if you wanted any level of comfort. For a moment this tripped you up, if you were getting younger shouldn&#39;t everything be getting smaller. But you weren&#39;t just getting younger. After all, no //male// teenager had hips like this.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

You paused, a creeping distress rising in you. &lt;&lt;if $traitFat || $traitChubby&gt;&gt;You looked down at the lumps pushing against your &lt;&lt;print getCurrentOutfit().top&gt;&gt;.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You looked back at the small bumps pushing against your &lt;&lt;print getCurrentOutfit().top&gt;&gt;.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Ignoring the discomfort you put your hands to your chest and squeezed. The sensations were...well there was a lot going on there that you didn&#39;t want to get into. But one thing was clear, &lt;&lt;if $traitFat&gt;&gt;that wasn&#39;t just extra fat.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;those weren&#39;t pecs.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You started at Emily&#39;s voice, you hadn&#39;t even noticed she was there. Her words made you question yourself for a moment, had you really missed that advice? No, that&#39;s impossible, why would your mother have ever given you that advice?

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;I wasn&#39;t, I mean I don&#39;t have\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;, you took a momentary pause to settle yourself,  &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;better question is //why// do I have them? You said the magic was going to make me \&#39;little\&#39;.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Emily looked away nervously, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;big girls have boobies, and you&#39;re still big.&quot;@@

That explained the salient point. The regression and the gender transformation were acting on you at the same time. So you hadn&#39;t just been regressed to a fourteen year old, you&#39;d also started picking up the traits of a @@.girlVoice;teenage girl@@.

It would be an odd race. Teenage girls were obviously curvier than teenage boys, so you&#39;d expect to get curvier. But once you started talking about pre-teens the differences shrunk. Would your breasts keep growing as you became @@.girlVoice;girlier@@? Or would the regression counteract the effects?

&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 14&gt;&gt;You&#39;d rather //neither// was happening, but you didn&#39;t have much choice on that one. Emily, and the party, were determined to make you into a @@.girlVoice;little girl@@.&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 12&gt;&gt;You had mixed feelings about it.

&lt;&lt;if $playerOutfit === 0&gt;&gt;\
	You leaned down and rolled up your jeans. At least it would let you move around without tripping. Straightening you took one last look in the mirror, strange as your reflection seemed. The stretched shirt, the straining jeans &lt;&lt;if $traitFat&gt;&gt;with some flab spilling over the top, belying your narrowing waist.&lt;&lt;elseif $traitChubby&gt;&gt;showing just a hint of a narrowing waist and a soft chubby stomach.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;showing just a hint of a narrow waist and a soft flat stomach.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 14&gt;&gt;You absolutely wouldn&#39;t accept that the one place the jeans did feel loose was right around your crotch.

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	You did your best to get your outfit to sit properly. Shrinking like this meant even your new outfit no longer fit quite right. The new outfit plus the new figure gave you an unfamiliar reflection. You were shrinking in some spots, &lt;&lt;if $traitFat&gt;&gt;at least in terms of skeletal structure. Your waist was narrower, but all your extra @@.girlVoice;flab@@ made it impossible to tell.&lt;&lt;elseif $traitChubby&gt;&gt;your waist was getting narrower, though your @@.girlVoice;chubby@@ stomach made it harder to tell.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;your waist had gotten narrower and your stomach was less defined.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 14&gt;&gt;The one part you absolutely couldn&#39;t accept was how much extra space their was in the front of your underwear.

You hurried over to a mirror to see what had fascinated her so. What looked back at you was...your normal face. Wait, no, that wasn&#39;t right, there was a change. Your mustache was gone. To be fair there wasn&#39;t much there before, but it had been //something//.

Her enthusiasm was infectious, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;come on Sophie! You gotta go faster!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Sophie shifted, resettling you into a better position and giving it her all as you pushed towards the finish line.

Unfortunately, your enthusiasm made you lose your grip on Sophie. She realized what was happening in the last moment and tried to recover it, but wasn&#39;t fast enough. The two of you tumbled to the ground.

It was a mess of limbs as you finally came to a stop, a sharp pain spiking inside your mouth before subsiding as quickly as it came.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;Is everyone okay?&quot;@@ Kara had rushed over to the crash site.

You took stock of yourself, other than that sharp pain, you&#39;d come out of this unharmed.

The same wasn&#39;t true for Sophie, @@.sophieVoice;&quot;owww,&quot;@@ she hissed as she started to untangle herself. You realized that the reason for your health was that your fall had been cushioned. Sophie had been the one to hit the floor, and you&#39;d landed on her.

More probing confirmed this as well. Your mouth had been a mish mash of baby and adult teeth with a bunch missing. Now, other than your front tooth, you had a full set. A full set of @@.girlVoice;baby teeth@@.

@@.mikiVoice;&quot;Just like me!&quot;@@ Miki smiled brightly, showing off her own missing front tooth.

This wasn&#39;t quite the encouragement she intended it to be. Miki was an entire year younger than you, you should have still been &quot;ahead&quot; of her on this one.

Physically you were down to Kara&#39;s size, in fact you had an inkling that she was actually a tiny bit bigger than you, but you didn&#39;t want to admit that. Which meant you were only mature when compared to Miki, and on some points you were merely equal. It was possible, if you really looked into it, that she would even be ahead on some. 

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;So cute,&quot;@@ Emily cooed at the two of you.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
Sitting on Emily&#39;s bed you watched as the girl&#39;s tore through Emily&#39;s closet looking for the perfect outfits. This time was much more contentious than the last. There were outfits being pulled and tossed, mixed and matched, compared and contrasted. 

Some of this conflict stemmed from simply having more options. For the twelve year old version of you Emily had tried to pick more &#39;mature&#39; outfits. The closet&#39;s magic would make sure it fit no matter what, but the style of an eight year old wouldn&#39;t usually suit a pre-teen.

Despite the dozens of outfits that had been considered, you were being presented with only six. Considering the smiles on the girls they seemed very pleased with their work. They didn&#39;t care what outfit you picked really, it was more about the fun of the dressup.

The first was a combination of a @@.girlVoice;pink blouse@@ with short jean shorts. &lt;&lt;if $playerOutfit === 1&gt;&gt;It was actually not terribly dissimilar from what you were wearing already.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;d seen something similar the first time Emily had dressed you up.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; Last time the shorts had been adorned with some stylish tears.

[[Pick this one|9 to 8 Age Regression 3][$playerOutfit to 13]]

The second was a combination piece. The base was a @@.girlVoice;light pink princess dress@@ that would come just past your knees. The long sleeves had a cinch just behind the wrist so that the end of the sleeves @@.girlVoice;puffed@@ out a little, matching the profile of the skirt. The entire sleeve was a little loose so it had a @@.girlVoice;billowing elegant@@ look. The second piece was a jean vest. A glance to Kara&#39;s own jean jacket made you wonder if one had inspired the other. Though while Kara&#39;s jean jacket was fairly sedate, this vest had some extra embellishments. There was a large @@.girlVoice;pink ribbon@@ below each of the breast pockets, and the collar was studded with @@.girlVoice;pink beads@@.

The third was where Emily had really let herself go wild. It was a knee length dress, but the rest was difficult to describe. It was a @@.girlVoice;rainbow of colors@@, but each color had it&#39;s own layer going sideways across the dress. It gave almost a tulle effect, but perpendicular to how it usually was.

Emily had also put a beaded necklace out with it, to complete the look. It wasn&#39;t something you figured she&#39;d wear on a normal day, but it did fit for a party.

The fifth finally broke the trend and was a simple long sleeve shirt and pants. Though far be it from them to look more &#39;manly&#39;. The pants were a @@.girlVoice;bright rainbow@@ what normally would have been dark purple having been replaced with a @@.girlVoice;bright pink@@. The shirt was even more a cornucopia of colors. The sleeves were a matching rainbow but the main shirt had bunch of @@.girlVoice;flowers@@ in various styles. Some even with hearts in the center. There was an elephant and a giraffe and the words &quot;Beautiful Far Away Journey&quot; across the bottom.

	Your head swam for a moment and you considered the words you&#39;d just thought. Those weren&#39;t your thoughts, those were the words that Emily had spoken to you. No doubt she&#39;d messed with your head so you&#39;d want to wear it.

	@@.karaVoice;&quot;You should go to the bathroom to change.&quot;@@ Kara&#39;s voice was gentle and slow, her words were more a lesson than an order.

	You supposed you should, if Kara wanted you to, but you didn&#39;t really see why. You were the same age after all, what did it matter if they saw you in your underwear? Regardless you nodded and made your way to the bathroom, outfit in hand.

	Closing the door behind you, you were left alone in the privacy of the room. You started to get changed.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &lt;= 9&gt;&gt;\
	For a moment you considered just changing your outfit there and then. You were all girls here, it wasn&#39;t like they would be seeing anything untoward. Hell, Emily would basically just be looking into a mirror. It really wouldn&#39;t be much of an issue.

	Still, something felt a little awkward about it. Even if they were the same age you consciously knew you were supposed to try and get some privacy. Even if it didn&#39;t bother you, you wouldn&#39;t want to make anything awkward.

	So you made your way to the bathroom. Closing the door behind you, you took a breath. That slight awkward feeling gone now that you were alone. Now in private you began to get changed.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	You took the outfit and made your way to the bathroom to get changed. Just because you were their age now didn&#39;t mean you were about to change in front of them. You still had your modesty and changing into a girly outfit in full public view was a gross violation of that.

	So you made your way to the bathroom. Closing the door behind you, you began to get changed.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

In your mostly undressed state you took a look at your body. You didn&#39;t get a lot of opportunity to calmly check yourself, and with your body changing the way it was, there were always new things to see.

Though in this case it was less that there was anything new to see, but the conspicuous lack of anything to see. You hadn&#39;t been &#39;womanly&#39; in quite some time, but you&#39;d at least had some feminine traits. @@.girlVoice;Now all of that was gone@@. You were flat, everywhere. Even the slight curve of your hips had faded away. The last hints of puberty having been erased from your body. 

Just by your figure there was no real way to tell if you were a boy or a girl. &lt;&lt;if $hairstyle !== 0&gt;&gt;Your hair was the only real marker of your gender.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You short hair made you look even more boyish.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 8&gt;&gt;You hated the idea.

Though Miki hadn&#39;t teased you like the others, so you didn&#39;t need to avenge yourself by making her look silly or anything. It was time for Miki&#39;s makeover.

It was actually pretty fun, intently watching as Kara went through another lesson.  There was a shocking amount to learn, though it was clear Kara only knew a fraction of it. It was a strange feeling learning something right alongside your sister, doubly so because she was actually already ahead of you. The most nerve-racking moment was when you were tasked with doing the mascara. It was tough to even keep your hand stable. This was way harder than you&#39;d thought. But you managed it, much to the excitement of the other girls. They were singing along to the poppy tunes of Katy Perry as they finished dolling Miki up. It was easy to get swept up in their enthusiasm. You didn&#39;t know all the words, but you started getting a feel for it. Soon enough you were @@.girlVoice;singing along@@ with the rest.

Finally, Miki&#39;s makeup was done. In the end, it was even more over the top than yours. You had sparkly lips, but Miki had sparkly everything. It looked like her makeup had been done by, well, a bunch of little girls...though your contribution was no better. As nervous as you were at the task you&#39;d ended up erring on the side of over rather than underdoing it. If you were going to put on makeup people should see it, right? 

But Miki was absolutely thrilled with the result. Her joy increased your own happiness with your own look. If Miki could be happy about looking like that, then you could too. Sure it was a bit over the top, but it was still @@.girlVoice;really pretty@@. You looked like you were about to perform on stage or in a movie.

You helped do a couple of things to the other girls, though they weren&#39;t interested in more than just lipstick or mascara. Finally, once everyone had had their fun it was time to get cleaned up. Despite the extra layers of makeup Miki and you were actually the most reluctant to wash it off. The two of you looked @@.girlVoice;so mature@@ it was a shame to get rid of it. But that much makeup wasn&#39;t good for the skin if left on too long. Plus the rest of the activities would probably ruin it anyway.

You weren&#39;t exactly sure what you wanted to do, but some time alone would probably be nice.

In the end wandered towards some awards on a shelf, trying to remember what they were all from. You knew some of your memories had been fading and you wanted to hold onto what you could. Turning over a small glass trophy in your hand you attempted to recall the origin, it&#39;d been something from sports right? Soccer maybe? No you hadn&#39;t played that much...

@@.karaVoice;&quot;What are you looking at &lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt;?&quot;@@ You jumped at the sudden voice, dropping the trophy as you did. It fell to the floor and shattered into a million pieces.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;You broke it!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; you screeched. This was a reflexive response, not a rational one. You were just @@.girlVoice;mad@@ and looking for someone to blame.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Shut up! Why&#39;d you break it?!\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;

Emily raised an eyebrow, @@.emilyVoice;&quot;You being clumsy isn&#39;t her fault.&quot;@@ 

Your face went even more red and you were about to start screaming at Emily when you realized something. You hadn&#39;t actually explained anything, you&#39;d just yelled and accused. For some reason you&#39;d just expected Emily and Sophie to know what had happened. 

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;You need a time out. You can come back when you&#39;re ready say sorry.&quot;@@

You opened your mouth to protest, but with a wave of her wand you found yourself protesting to empty air. Empty air and darkness. You got the feeling you&#39;d been taken somewhere else, but where?

[[Search for a light|12 to 11 Maturity Change 1c]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1208" name="12 to 11 Maturity Change 1c" tags="" position="975,15100" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if $traitAfraidOfTheDark&gt;&gt;\
	You fumbled around for a light switch. When none immediately presented itself you could feel a growing @@.girlVoice;terror in your chest@@. You were all alone, in the dark, in an unknown location. All you had to do was find a light and you&#39;d be fine, you just had to find it.

	Your desperate search became more and more frenzied. You&#39;d already banged yourself against half a dozen unknown objects, which only made you more panicked. Who knew what you were bumping into?

	&lt;&lt;if $traitCrybaby or $playerMaturity &lt;=8&gt;&gt;Whimpering you ran your hand along what seemed to be an exterior wall. You were already @@.girlVoice;sniffling@@ and @@.girlVoice;sobbing@@ by the time you finally found the switch. Revealing the terrifying nightmare location to be...your basement. You felt like such an idiot. Here you were with @@.girlVoice;teary eyes@@ and a @@.girlVoice;runny nose@@, and it was just your own basement. The only mercy was that none of the girls were here to see it.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Shivering you ran your hand along what seemed to be an exterior wall. Your hand brushing what you hoped was a light switch. Eagerly you flipped it, revealing the terrifying nightmare location to be...your basement. You felt like such an idiot.

	&lt;&lt;changeEmbarassment &quot;small&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	You fumbled around for a light switch. There was a vague familiarity with the location so you were quickly able to find something. Revealing the fact that the mystery location was just the basement. 
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Heading up to the basement door you tugged on it, to no avail. Locked. Shouting for someone to open the door had no effect. It looked like you&#39;d been grounded and were stuck in &#39;time out&#39; until Emily decided otherwise. 

&lt;&lt;if $traitSoftspoken &amp;&amp; $traitGRatedLanguage&gt;&gt;\
	But you probably deserved it. You&#39;d yelled and been a @@.girlVoice;bad girl@@. You @@.girlVoice;weren&#39;t supposed to raise your voice@@ like that, and you felt @@.girlVoice;really guilty@@. You wanted to go up and apologize right now, but the door stubbornly wouldn&#39;t open. It&#39;d be at least a little while before you could go. Maybe you could find something to do?
&lt;&lt;elseif $traitSoftspoken&gt;&gt;\
	Honestly it was a bit of a shock that you&#39;d been able to raise your voice like that at all. You&#39;d just been so mad that it seemed to overwrite your normal behaviour. Now you&#39;d have to take some time and get yourself calmed down. You needed to find something to do to burn off some stress.
&lt;&lt;elseif $traitMonophobia&gt;&gt;
	But being in the light didn&#39;t fix the whole issue. You were still down here entirely by yourself for the foreseeable future. There had to be a way that you could get yourself back upstairs with the group. Maybe if you could distract yourself, calm down, she&#39;d let you back up.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	You&#39;d gotten your alone time, but it&#39;d come at a cost. It was calm, too calm, there wasn&#39;t anything to do //at all//. You groaned, you might be stuck down here all day, @@.girlVoice;mind numbingly bored@@.

[[Find something to do|12 to 11 Maturity Change 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1209" name="12 to 11 Maturity Change 2" tags="" position="1100,15100" size="100,100">Your mother had never gotten around to finishing this basement. Which meant it was a concrete floor and blank walls. Within five minutes you were @@.girlVoice;going crazy@@ it was so @@.girlVoice;boring@@.

Then your eye caught something in the corner...your old laptop! It was a miracle. It was going to be seriously out of date, but at least it was something. You just had to see what games you had available. Surprisingly you actually had a pretty good number of choices, but most of it didn&#39;t seem that appealing. Best to start with an old standby.

[[Overwatch|Video Game Overwatch]]
[[Street Fighter|Video Game Street Fighter]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1210" name="Video Game Overwatch" tags="" position="1225,15100" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;VideoGames/Stills/Overwatch.webp&#39; &quot;medium&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Shooters were always a good way to burn off some frustration and Overwatch was one of the best. Fast paced, lots of variety, fun characters. Should be a nice little distraction for a bit. You were pretty good at the game after all, so a few crushing wins should really raise your mood.

Though your first game was terribly unlucky. You usually played Reinhart, big guy, tanky, but slow. Great at defending the team, but couldn&#39;t push without support...and you weren&#39;t getting any. Your team kept yelling at you saying you were &#39;out of position&#39;. It was annoying but you knew it was @@.girlVoice;all their fault@@. You were just pushing forward while they were just waiting around doing nothing. 

Your next few games were no better, and you were getting really tired of waiting around. Beyond people being passive in game, everything was so slow. There were queues for the game, then picking characters, then a countdown, and then you had to wait ages every time you died.

You&#39;d had enough, time for a change. Tracer. She was like the fastest character in the game so you wouldn&#39;t have to wait around. Though before you could actually play you had to choose the right cosmetics. You hadn&#39;t cared with Reinhart, but Tracer was @@.girlVoice;way cuter@@. 

Finally you managed to settle on a skin and get into a game...then the second you taunted you realized the skin didn&#39;t look right from the back. You considered what to do...Your team was losing badly anyway, might as well leave and fix it. You quit out to pick a new one. You had middling success, they weren&#39;t really //that// many outfits and they all were pretty much the same. Before you even got into another match you&#39;d gotten bored of the whole procedure. You weren&#39;t into Overwatch today, you needed something else.

[[Choose another Game|12 to 11 Maturity Change 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1211" name="Video Game Street Fighter" tags="" position="100,15225" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;VideoGames/Stills/StreetFighter.webp&#39; &quot;medium&quot;&gt;&gt;\
Street Fighter seemed like something you could get into. It required such a level of focus that you&#39;d be too engaged to worry about everything else. Logging in you went to your old standby, Ken. Sure he wasn&#39;t the most exciting character, but excitement wasn&#39;t as important as winning.

If only you could get a win. Maybe it was the laptop, maybe it was rust, maybe it was just being in the wrong headspace, but you couldn&#39;t seem to land anything. Your opponents seemed to be able to read every single move you made. After a particularly brutal beating by a Karin player you were about to throw in the towel. But maybe if you can&#39;t beat them, join them. Karin time.

Your first game was ok, you didn&#39;t win but things did feel closer. But you hated how she looked by default, going straight to the costumes after the games. There were a good number of options, but most of them were just color variations. At least the nostalgia costume was @@.girlVoice;cute@@ and the 30th anniversary one was @@.girlVoice;pretty@@, but you were bored of the whole thing. You didn&#39;t want to play this any more. You needed something new.

Shooters were pretty high tempo, but you could play one single player and still have fun. With advances in emulator technology you could even play a Wii game. Time for a classic, Splatoon. Bunch of squid kids having a glorified water gun fight, what could be more fun than that?

The game was fun...for about half of the first game. Turns out your mind wasn&#39;t really in this one either, the AI kept sneaking up on you or sniping you. Every time it happened it made you @@.girlVoice;more annoyed@@. The more annoyed you got the worse you played.

This continued a little while longer before you gave up entirely on playing matches. Instead messing around with some of the social features, this was limited considering you were offline. There were some customization though but changing your Inkling&#39;s &#39;hair&#39; colour wasn&#39;t really that fun. You sighed, if you were going to keep getting distracted with @@.girlVoice;dressing up@@ your character, you&#39;d be better off finding something that properly supported it.

[[Choose another Game|12 to 11 Maturity Change 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1214" name="Video Game Neptunia" tags="" position="475,15225" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;VideoGames/Stills/Neptunia.webp&#39; &quot;medium&quot;&gt;&gt;\
A drastic change of pace was in order. Your laptop wasn&#39;t really up for the task of hardcore competitive gaming and to be honest neither were you. A JRPG sounded like a good idea. Turn based, so it didn&#39;t matter if the controls were awkward and you didn&#39;t have to think nearly as fast. Plus the Neptunia games were pretty easy, a fun romp with some @@.girlVoice;cute anime girls@@ rather than anything challenging. 

Though these games weren&#39;t made with the highest budgets, so you ended up seeing the same enemies again and again, just in different color palettes. After the third variant color of a Doggo you were bored of the whole thing. 

At least the game had a few other things to keep attention. The cutscenes were pretty funny and it was fun messing around with gear choices. Every girl had a super mode, and you could equip different armor pieces for that mode. The legs, the arms, the headgear, etc.

But even this wasn&#39;t able to hold your attention long. After all the options were also mostly palette swaps. The only thing that seemed to be holding your attention right now was customization, maybe you could find a game to scratch that itch?

[[Choose another Game|12 to 11 Maturity Change 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1215" name="12 to 11 Maturity Change 4" tags="" position="600,15225" size="100,100">You still weren&#39;t finding anything that you could sink your teeth into. Everything was either too hard, too boring or both. You wanted something that would let you play with some more character personalization.

[[The Sims|Video Game The Sims]]
[[Stardew Valley|Video Game Stardew Valley]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1216" name="Video Game The Sims" tags="" position="725,15225" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;Image &#39;VideoGames/Stills/TheSims.webp&#39; &quot;medium&quot;&gt;&gt;\
If you weren&#39;t in the mood for anything with real action, maybe a simulation game would suit you. The Sims wasn&#39;t your usual fare, you&#39;d usually found it too uneventful. It was basically just interior decorating the game, but you&#39;d never gotten around to deleting it. Today was different; you were invested in your Sim and the life they were living. If nothing else it was cathartic to have a proper set of customization options.

This all came to a head when it was time for a wedding. You&#39;d totally gotten into it now, there was so much to prepare and you really had to focus. By the time your Sim was walking down the aisle you were feeling the palpable relief of a job well done. Well, that and enjoying how @@.girlVoice;pretty@@ the @@.girlVoice;wedding dress@@ you&#39;d picked was. How you were going to make such a @@.girlVoice;lovely bride@@...well not you, but your Sim...wait, since when were you playing the bride instead of the groom? You&#39;d thought that you were planning for the groom...but no you remembered picking out dresses and shoes for the @@.girlVoice;bride@@. You shook your head, the bride had more options anyway, that&#39;s probably how it&#39;d happened. But you still didn&#39;t like how into the role you&#39;d gotten. Maybe there was something else.

If you weren&#39;t in the mood for anything with real action, maybe a simulation game would suit you. Stardew Valley wasn&#39;t your usual fare, you&#39;d played it before, but bounced off of it pretty quickly. Today it was much more your speed. There was something calming about slowly expanding your farm. You were even able to get some chickens and even a cow to take care of. It might have been over the top but you made sure to go and talk to each of them twice in a day, it seemed to make them happy. Time blurred as your kept playing, it was hard to tell if you&#39;d been playing for minutes or hours...

It gave you time to build relationships with all the people in town. They were such an interesting group of people Marney was the one who&#39;d sold you the animals. Harvey had some sad secret that you hadn&#39;t been able to figure out yet. Maru was really energetic and Jas was adorable. Though you ended up spending a lot of time with Elliot. His story was interesting and you had a good sense of what gifts he liked, so the two of you quickly grew closer. 

You didn&#39;t really know where the relationship was heading, but you were eager to find out. Next he&#39;d invited onto a boat and was blabbering on about his book, and how you&#39;d supported him and he suddenly @@.girlVoice;kissed you@@. You @@.girlVoice;squealed@@ out loud at the sudden turn of events. He was @@.girlVoice;so cute@@ and for a moment you felt just as happy as your character did. It seemed only moments later that the two of you were going to get married. There was a small panic because your character had nothing but overalls, luckily through some swift dyeing and tailoring you were able to make a proper @@.girlVoice;wedding dress@@ It was only a sprite based game, but in your imagination it was so @@.girlVoice;elegant@@.

You shook your head, you hadn&#39;t even realized you&#39;d been playing as a girl the whole time. You&#39;d blame the simple graphics for the confusion, but even you didn&#39;t believe that. It&#39;d just felt natural to play as a girl, and to be @@.girlVoice;kissing boys@@ but mooning over a @@.girlVoice;wedding dress@@? That was too much, you needed a change of pace.

You felt like you&#39;d calmed down, but there was no sign of impending freedom. All this over some dumb sports trophy. You didn&#39;t even know what it was for except that it&#39;d gotten you in trouble. Sports were always trouble, games like these were way more fun. You could play @@.girlVoice;dress up@@ and didn&#39;t have to get all dirty. 

In desperation you pulled out your phone. You had never installed any games on it before, but now seemed like a good time to break that trend...except you couldn&#39;t get a signal down here and were stuck with whatever you had.

Calculator. Maps. Calendar. Contacts. Settings. Clock. Love Nikki?

Huh? You didn&#39;t recognize that app at all, when had you installed it? Maybe it was a preload? Either way, &#39;Love Nikki&#39; was such an odd name that you had to try it, even if you didn&#39;t know what to expect

When you opened it you were bombarded with a dizzying array of unfamiliar options. Events and quests and achievements and countdown and frostbite and wardrobe...Wardrobe you at least understood, so you started your investigation there. Once again you were entirely overwhelmed by what you saw, this was no ordinary wardrobe, there were //thousands// of items to choose from. Apparently you already owned a small fraction of them, and even that would be enough for a vast wardrobe in the real world. You scrolled through the options: hairstyles, dresses, shoes, accessories, makeup, it was a //crazy// amount of stuff. Clearly a lot of work had been put into this, but how much detail did they have?

You clicked on a random item, &quot;Snow Kite Elf&quot;. Turned out to be a @@.girlVoice;super cute pink dress@@. But you only got to see the dress itself, not how it looked on a character. Annoyed you clicked again to actually put it on...but you didn&#39;t own it...in fact you had to make something else first and then dye it into this. You cast a glance at the door, still locked, so you had a bit of time to kill.

It was going to be a process. You needed to play a few levels to get the items to turn into the dress, and then you had to find a way to get the dye and have enough money for the whole process...you hunkered down and got to work. 

The &#39;game&#39; itself turned out to be a series of @@.girlVoice;dress-up competitions@@. Making the best outfit you could based upon a given theme. Sure it was @@.girlVoice;girly@@ but it had a somewhat interesting story as. Plus you just needed to know what that dress looked like and then you&#39;d be done, just scratching that curious itch. 

What ensued was a flurry of competitions, trying your best with your limited resources. &lt;&lt;if $traitShopaholic&gt;&gt;At least until you found the store. You could get a //ton// of resources and seriously speed up the process.

@@.emilyVoice;&quot;Are you ready to apologize?&quot;@@ Her look was hesitant, unsure of your current mental state.

Kara bristled at the implication that she only hated them because she kept losing...but Sophie wasn&#39;t entirely wrong. You totally understood the feeling, playing was no fun if you were losing. Maybe the two of you could swap stories and leave the @@.girlVoice;gross boy games@@ to Sophie.

But when you looked for the girls they were out of immediate eyeshot. Finally you saw them clustered in the corner, the four of them looking at a phone and giggling. Sophie took the phone and held it out as far as she could, the four of them pressing close together so they could all get in frame. 

Selfies, you&#39;d seen enough of that vapid hobby from the girls at school. You had no intent of-@@.karaVoice;&quot;&lt;&lt;playerName&gt;&gt; you should join us&quot;@@-joining.

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Fine.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; You made your way over to the group as they made room for you. It rapidly became clear that one selfie was not going to be enough to satisfy the group. They had to get the &#39;&#39;right&#39;&#39; picture. Which meant a seemingly endless set of faces and poses.

At first you were awkward and stiff, you were ambivalent about this and it showed. But their relentless enthusiasm and abundant joy at the activity was infectious. Soon enough you were @@.girlVoice;throwing up peace signs@@ with Miki, @@.girlVoice;making funny faces@@ with Emily and joining all of them in @@.girlVoice;blowing a kiss@@ to the camera. &lt;&lt;if $traitImaginaryFriend &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;$imaginaryFriendName was posing with you as well, though she never appeared in the actual picture.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $karaInferiorityComplex&gt;&gt;You just @@.girlVoice;followed Kara&#39;s lead@@ when you didn&#39;t know.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

After you took a picture of you and Kara @@.girlVoice;sticking your tongues out@@, Sophie declared the selfie session over. You couldn&#39;t count the number that had been taken but it felt like dozens. You had enjoyed it despite yourself. Once you stopped being so uptight and self-conscious it was easy to just follow along with the group. &lt;&lt;if $traitCatgirl&gt;&gt;Kara had a particular obsession with you doing a cat paw pose, but even you had to admit it was @@.girlVoice;adorable@@.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;Okay let&#39;s do this\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;, you weren&#39;t as enthused as Kara but it didn&#39;t sound too bad. You were having @@.girlVoice;so much fun@@ that you didn&#39;t want it to stop.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;Okay so you have to answer some questions...&quot;@@, she began reading out the questions and their options.

But a few stood out because they actually made you think.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;What&#39;s your favourite band?&quot;@@, now obviously it didn&#39;t have a list of //all// bands, so you were stuck with the four that were there.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;Dream job?&quot;@@, this one had more options, and even had &#39;accountant&#39;. But the more you thought about it, the more you were realizing how @@.girlVoice;super boring@@ it would be. Math, or at least the Math you remembered, was also @@.girlVoice;kinda boring@@.

Obviously that was the whole idea, but it was getting easier to accidentally slip into those childish behaviours. Maybe you just needed a few moments to settle yourself?

Plopping yourself down on the couch you surfed Netflix. Maybe something would catch your eye and distract you for a bit.

@@.karaVoice;&quot;We should watch The Dragon Prince,&quot;@@ Kara settled herself down on the couch beside you. Patiently waiting for your answer, when you were slow to obey, @@.karaVoice;&quot;I promise it&#39;s good.&quot;@@

This episode was well into the series, so you weren&#39;t doing a great job of following along but it did seem decently entertaining. The main girl, Rayla, actually did seem pretty cool. You were less convinced on the male lead, whose name you didn&#39;t even know. 

That all changed in a moment when the pair of them were on a boat. The boy was going on about how amazing Rayla was, as they got closer and closer...were they about to...both you and Kara waited with baited breath.

Looking at Kara&#39;s still blushing face you wanted to tease her, but that would require getting the blush off of your own face first. Why was this flustering you so much?

Maybe you were overthinking this. The whole scene had been @@.girlVoice;romantic@@ and @@.girlVoice;passionate@@ and you&#39;d gotten caught up in the moment. Maybe it was just kissing that had you so flustered.

This was insane, how was it even remotely reasonable that your sister would be allowed to mess with you like this? How could your mother not just allow this, but actually set it up and encourage it? @@.girlVoice;It&#39;s just not fair.@@

You exhaled, trying to center yourself. It was no good to let your emotions get the better of you. You had to keep yourself in check so you could actually understand what was happening to you.

But how could you use an altered mind to examine whether it had been altered? Maybe your memories? You knew what a normal day and a normal week was, so maybe you could use that as a baseline and see what changed?

Yesterday was Friday, what classes did you have on Fridays? The morning was English and History. In English you were reading Brave New World, a complicated book, but you mostly got it. History was just more about World War 1, too many dates to remember, but that was standard.

Lunch. Usual table, usual classmates. You weren&#39;t really close to anyone, but you&#39;d been chatting to Mark about cars, a conversation that went on for far too long&lt;&lt;if !$knowledgeCars&gt;&gt;, and you @@.girlVoice;didn&#39;t understand@@&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;.

At the time you&#39;d been bored to tears but as you reminisced it was actually @@.girlVoice;pretty interesting@@. There was apparently a whole community about it on Instagram that you&#39;d never heard about.

The afternoon was your favourite subject, Math. It was actually pretty neat, you&#39;d just gotten into pre-calc which you could use to&lt;span class=&quot;blurOutText&quot;&gt; do all kinds of neat stuff. For example, in the syllabus there was vectors for forces, some basic probability, matrices, though you didn&#39;t know much about them yet.&lt;/span&gt;...what was it again? You remembered going to the class, but the details that were discussed eluded you. What about the week before? Linear equations which were...about lines or something?

You couldn&#39;t remember, that Math knowledge was gone. No doubt other stuff  as well, but it is an impossible task to remember all the things you&#39;d forgotten. You glanced over at your sister, happily chatting away with the others. Apparently her threat extended beyond just acting like a kid. If this kept up you &#39;&#39;were&#39;&#39; going to end up empty headed and giggling for real.

See Kara and Sophie had been put in charge of a little baking project while Emily kept Miki entertained. The concept was simple enough, a few ingredients in a mug, throw it in the microwave, wait a couple minutes and you&#39;d all have brownies. Mom had made sure things were all prepared since you were all @@.girlVoice;too little@@ to play with the oven.

&lt;&lt;if $cupcakeDecoratingActivityResult&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
The complication apparently came from the recipe itself. It had all been written pre-written on the back of the box and at a glance it all looked fine. 

&lt;div class=&quot;recipe-paper&quot;&gt;\
Serves 8
2 cups of brownie mix
1/8 cup water
1/3 teaspoon miniature marshmallows
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup egg product

1. In small bowl, mix brownie mix, egg product, vegetable oil and water.
2. Microwave uncovered on High 40 to 50 seconds, immediately top with marshmallows. Wait 1 minute to cool. Serve.
&lt;/div&gt;\

It had been written for a single tray, serving eight people, not how much it would be for five. Even if it had been for five you&#39;d still need to break it up into the five separate mugs.

@@.sophieVoice;&quot;So you do it for us okay? How much brownie mix for each cup?&quot;@@

You looked between the box and the mugs. A knot built in the pit of your stomach. This was //a lot// of different numbers to be playing with all at once.

Clearly Emily had held some boy&#39;s hand, something Sophie thought was a scandal by itself. Yet Emily rejected the possibility of kissing the same boy, even though she was clearly interested in the concept. It seemed like thinking about it was one thing, but actually doing it was years away. Yet Sophie, a year older, wasn&#39;t even interested in the idea, or at least was consistent at denying it.

But none of this answered the fundamental question of why anyone would want to do any of that ever. @@.girlVoice;Boys were gross@@. The idea of holding one&#39;s hand was @@.girlVoice;double gross@@ and //kissing// one was @@.girlVoice;infinity gross@@. &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &gt;= 11&gt;&gt;The fact that technically, physically, you were still sort of one was far from your mind.

Girls weren&#39;t gross, and they didn&#39;t have @@.girlVoice;cooties@@, so holding one&#39;s hand would probably be fine. You would hold @@.girlVoice;mommy&#39;s@@ hand after all, and she was a girl. If you were crossing the street together, or didn&#39;t want to get separated in a crowd...there were tons of reasons you might hold another girl&#39;s hand. 

As for kissing, you could see @@.girlVoice;mommy kissing you goodnight@@ and you would @@.girlVoice;kiss her back@@. So kissing girls was okay obviously, so why had this all seemed like a big deal? Maybe Emily was just embarrassed because @@.girlVoice;boys were dirty@@ and she&#39;d accidentally held one&#39;s hand? Instead of @@.girlVoice;knowing better@@ like you and Sophie. Emily was @@.girlVoice;so stupid@@ sometimes, doing something @@.girlVoice;gross@@ like that. That&#39;s how you knew you were still @@.girlVoice;smarter@@ and @@.girlVoice;more mature@@ than her.

You paused, there was something off about this train of logic, but you couldn&#39;t place what. Was there some deeper reason someone might want to kiss a boy or a girl?

&lt;&lt;elseif $allAboutMeName === $playerName&gt;&gt;\
	In the end you decided to stick with your old name. You didn&#39;t really like it, but you still sort of felt attached to it. Plus you couldn&#39;t think of anything better so best to stick with it for now.

Don&#39;t call me...\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;, for a moment you blanked on your old name. 

	You rallied, &lt;&lt;playerVoice &quot;\&quot;don&#39;t call me $playerName anymore.\&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; It wasn&#39;t like you&#39;d forgotten it, it just felt @@.girlVoice;weird@@ to think about it, like it @@.girlVoice;belonged to someone else@@.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;if $playerAge === 16&gt;&gt;\
	This was easy. You were sixteen. Even if your brain didn&#39;t feel like it anymore, your body hadn&#39;t changed.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
	The next blank was technically trivial, you just had to put in your age. But your age had been in constant flux since this sleepover had started. So you couldn&#39;t be totally sure how old you were, and did it want the answer for your mind or for your body. &#39;You&#39;re only as old as you feel&#39; came to mind, but that phrase wasn&#39;t considering the current situation. 

	To prevent any further confusion you decided on just putting your body&#39;s age...now you just had to figure that out.
	
	&lt;&lt;if $playerAge &lt;= 5&gt;&gt;\
		You were @@.girlVoice;smaller than Miki@@, which meant you were probably younger as well. Miki was six...so maybe five? Unless it was four...no that sounded too young. If you were four there would have been more signs. So five it is.

		You were @@.girlVoice;about the same size as Miki@@, which meant you were probably six just like Miki.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $playerAge === 7&gt;&gt;\
		You were @@.girlVoice;about the same size as Kara@@, which meant you were probably seven like Kara.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $playerAge === 8&gt;&gt;\
		Emily was @@.girlVoice;basically your twin@@ so you //had// to be the same age. Which meant you were eight.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $playerAge === 9&gt;&gt;\
		Sophie was only a fraction bigger than you, but she was big for her age. So you were probably still the same age as her. Nine years old, just @@.girlVoice;on the small side@@ of it.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $playerAge === 10&gt;&gt;\
		Sophie was a little smaller than you, and she was nine, which meant you probably weren&#39;t much more than ten.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		This was going to be complicated. You were a good amount bigger than any of the girls, but still @@.girlVoice;smaller@@ than you had been. Not to mention the fact you were somewhere between boy and girl, making your current status even more ambiguous. Making your best guess you put down $playerAge. In the end it wouldn&#39;t actually matter, and it did //feel// right.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

Having your age down made grade a lot easier. &lt;&lt;if $playerAge &lt;= 4&gt;&gt;Though since you were @@.girlVoice;too young for school@@ you just left it blank.&lt;&lt;elseif $playerAge === 5 &gt;&gt;You were a year younger than Miki, and she was in 1st grade, which meant...well you knew the answer was &#39;kindergarden&#39;, but that wouldn&#39;t exactly fit. At a loss you just put &#39;0th&#39; and moved on.&lt;&lt;elseif $playerAge &gt;= 6 &amp;&amp; $playerAge &lt;= 9&gt;&gt;If you were the @@.girlVoice;same age@@ as one of the girls, then you&#39;d be in the same grade. &lt;&lt;if $playerAge === 6&gt;&gt;Though you did almost write down &#39;1th&#39;.&lt;&lt;elseif $playerAge === 7&gt;&gt;Though you did almost write down &#39;2th&#39;&lt;&lt;elseif $playerAge === 8&gt;&gt;Though you did almost write down &#39;3th&#39;&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Unfortunately since you were older than the girls you&#39;d have to do a little math. //So if Sophie is nine and in grade 4 and I&#39;m...// you took a pause...you&#39;d gotten a little confused with three different numbers running around. It was okay though and you&#39;d figured it out a moment later, you were in &lt;&lt;print ($playerAge - 5) + &#39;th&#39;&gt;&gt; grade. Why had that @@.girlVoice;been so hard@@? You were able to work through it, but it wasn&#39;t automatic anymore, @@.girlVoice;you had to focus to do simple math@@.&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

Next was &#39;teacher&#39; which totally didn&#39;t matter so you just scrawled in the first thing that came to mind. Ms. Frizzle. Good enough. Though this space was so small you&#39;d had to squish it in.

Birthday was also straightforward. It was September 7th. Though you supposed that the year would have changed. If the year was $currentYear, and you used to be 16 and now you were $playerAge then you were born in...

You abandoned the task, you were sure you could figure it out. But cal-calu @@.girlVoice;mathing it@@ would take too long, best to move on.

Best Friend. You tried to think back to school, your old school, the one with all the @@.girlVoice;big kids@@. It seemed so impossibly far away right now, you could barely picture yourself going somewhere like that. Surely you had friends there...

There were some @@.girlVoice;gross boys@@ you remembered knowing fairly well, but now you couldn&#39;t imagine why. You could //never// put a boy as your best friend. Which left the girls.

Communication Skills:\
&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 14&gt;&gt;
	You&#39;re able to eloquently explain yourself, even when describing complex concepts. You&#39;re able to mediate differences of opinions.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 12&gt;&gt;
	You&#39;re able to explain concrete ideas, but you sometimes struggle with abstract concepts. Differences of opinion can be very frustrating.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;
	Your speech is nearly on an adult level. But you find it difficult to explain ideas to those who have a different understanding.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity == 9&gt;&gt;
	In speech you&#39;re able to use grammar correctly most of the time, but your written words are more error prone. Fully explaining your thoughts and feelings can be difficult.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 7&gt;&gt;
	You&#39;re able to express simple concepts verbally, but often find your vocabulary lacking. Writing is a struggle, you&#39;re wrong more often than you&#39;re right. You&#39;re able to read some things, but unfamiliar words still trip you up. It is difficult to comprehend a differing point of view.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity == 6&gt;&gt;
	You&#39;re able to express simple concepts verbally, but find your vocabulary extremely lacking. Writing is a serious struggle, only able to get across the most basic of concepts, and often still not making sense. Likewise you can only read the most basic of phrases. It is near impossible to comprehend a differing point of view.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity == 5&gt;&gt;
	People are able to understand what you are saying, but the words are simple and things like tenses are often wrong. Writing is impossible, little more than near random letters. You can recognize a few written words, but it&#39;d be a stretch to call it &quot;reading&quot;.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 3&gt;&gt;
	It is difficult to string together more than a couple words, which makes understanding you difficult. Now and again you slip non-words into your sentences further confusing people. Other people often use words you don&#39;t understand. You cannot read or write.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 1&gt;&gt;
	You know no more than a handful of words. Making explaining or understanding anything beyond the most basic of concepts impossible. You can, usually, almost, say your name.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
	You can make nothing more than babbling noises that no one can understand. It doesn&#39;t seem like you understand anything anyone else is saying.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
Independence:\
&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 13&gt;&gt;
	You&#39;re comfortable doing things on your own, even against the protests of others.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 10&gt;&gt;
	Comfortable acting away from friends and family, but crumble quickly under peer pressure.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 8&gt;&gt;
	You can mostly act on your own in social situations, but are still anxious about what others think.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 6&gt;&gt;
	You worry about what others think of you, and act in order to gain approval. New situations are still scary.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 4&gt;&gt;
	You&#39;re able to do rote tasks on your own, but need guidance for anything new.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 2&gt;&gt;
	You&#39;re able to separate from others for a little while, but you need them nearby.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
	You always need someone at your side or you will panic.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
Self Control:\
&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 15&gt;&gt;
	You can keep most of your impulses in check, though some days are worse than others.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 12&gt;&gt;
	You are prone to large emotional swings, but you can usually keep control.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 8&gt;&gt;
	You have a modicum of control, but are easily overwhelmed when there is any pressure.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 4&gt;&gt;
	You can barely control yourself, you are ruled by emotion and easily distracted.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
	You don&#39;t even understand the concept of self control.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
Sexuality:\
&lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &gt;= 14&gt;&gt;
	You&#39;re confident that you like kissing girls.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 11&gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt;if $sexualityLock&gt;&gt;\
		You&#39;re a little shy about it, but you like to kiss girls.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
		You&#39;re shy about it, but you like to kiss girls, and &lt;&lt;if $playerMaturity &lt;= 12&gt;&gt;@@.strikethrough-pink;maybe@@&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;maybe&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt; boys too.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 9&gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt;if $sexualityLock&gt;&gt;\
		You blush at the idea of holding hands with someone you like.
	&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;\
		You blush at the idea of holding a boy&#39;s hand.
	&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 5&gt;&gt;
	You&#39;d never want to touch a boy&#39;s hand. Boys are gross.
&lt;&lt;elseif $playerMaturity &gt;= 3&gt;&gt;
	You know boys and girls are different, but you&#39;re not sure why it&#39;s important.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
	You don&#39;t even know there is a difference between boys and girls.

Education:\

	You get good marks in high school. Math is your strong suit, algebra, geometry and even calculus are within your grasp.
&lt;&lt;elseif $effectiveIntelligenceMaturity == 15&gt;&gt;
	You get subpar marks in high school. Math is your strong suit, algebra, geometry and even calculus are within your grasp.
&lt;&lt;elseif $effectiveIntelligenceMaturity == 14&gt;&gt;
	You get terrible marks in high school. Math is your strong suit, but you struggle the more complex concepts.

	Ghosts, goblins, fearsome beasts and monsters under the bed. All of these things were supposed to be the domain of fantasy books. But they @@.girlVoice;terrified@@ you. A cold wind might be a @@.girlVoice;ghost@@ sneaking up on you. Scratches on the floor a sign of @@.girlVoice;goblins@@ in the house. And you always had to be ready to pull your blankets over your head at night; everyone knew that was the only way to ward away the @@.girlVoice;scary monster under the bed@@.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $traitAfraidOfBugs&gt;&gt;\
	&#39;&#39;Afraid of Creepy Crawlies&#39;&#39;
	@@.girlVoice;Slugs@@ and @@.girlVoice;spiders@@ and @@.girlVoice;frogs@@ and @@.girlVoice;worms@@, you hated everything that slithered around on the ground.

&lt;&lt;if $traitRapunzelHair&gt;&gt;\
	&#39;&#39;Rapunzel Hair&#39;&#39;
	The length of your hair is insanely out of control. It pools around your feet when you stand still and you had to be careful when you walked lest you trip over the excess dragging on the floor. The curse wasn&#39;t even done. If not for the @@.girlVoice;cute hairclips@@ in your hair it would just keep growing. A few minutes without them and you would //really// be in a Rapunzel situation. Cutting it wouldn&#39;t work either, even with the hairclips it would grow back in an instant. 
	Luckily another part of the magic made sure your hair wouldn&#39;t get dirty from being dragged around. It was always @@.girlVoice;smooth@@ and @@.girlVoice;silky@@. Despite that, you &#39;&#39;knew&#39;&#39; had to brush it daily to keep it that way. It would take ages, but there was something soothing about @@.girlVoice;running a brush through your hair@@. Even when you didn&#39;t have a brush you often found yourself distractedly @@.girlVoice;running your fingers@@ through it or @@.girlVoice;fiddling@@ with a lock. 

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $traitCatgirl == 1&gt;&gt;\
	&#39;&#39;Nekomimi&#39;&#39;
	A rather unusual curse has left you with a few feline features. You have @@.girlVoice;adorable@@ cat ears poking out of the top of your head. The fur on them is incredibly soft, but it tickles if people touch them wrong. Your canine teeth have also gotten way sharper, and one of those @@.girlVoice;cute little fangs@@ seems to always be showing. You&#39;re also a little more @@.girlVoice;playful@@ and @@.girlVoice;energetic@@ than before, but it also makes you easier to distract.

	Your curse has progressed and you look even more @@.girlVoice;cat like@@ than before. You still have your ears and fangs, but now a long tail trailed out behind you. Sometimes you were able to control it but other times it seemed to have a mind of its own. Your nails have grown longer and are surprisingly sharp. Narrow, unmistakeably feline, slitted eyes have granted you excellent night vision.  Oh, and you have an uncontrollable habit of sometimes ending sentences with a saccharine @@.girlVoice;&quot;nya~&quot; :3@@

Of course it also makes it nearly impossible for anyone to take you seriously.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $traitBornToLose&gt;&gt;
	&#39;&#39;Born to Lose&#39;&#39;
	Emily&#39;s curse has turned you into a loser. You can&#39;t correctly guess a coin flip, your rolls always come up snake eyes, and you never seem to draw the card you want. No matter what game, sport or activity you pick, you can&#39;t win, and yet you can&#39;t figure out why. As disastrous as your luck seems to be your mind can&#39;t connect it back to Emily&#39;s curse. It just seems like another time when things didn&#39;t go your way. However, it&#39;s more than just bad luck. If required the very laws of the universe will bend to make sure you lose, //no matter what//.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\

But you struggle with some sounds; &quot;red&quot; becomes &quot;wed&quot;, &quot;that&quot; becomes &quot;dat&quot;, &#39;bought&#39; becomes &#39;bots&#39;, and that&#39;s just the start.

	Your @@.girlVoice;sissie@@ Emily now always refers to you as her @@.girlVoice;baby sister@@. It&#39;s humiliating every time she refers to you that way, but you are seemingly incapable of correcting it. Worse you can only think of her as your @@.girlVoice;sissie@@, making it sound like you&#39;re too young to even be able to pronounce &quot;sister&quot;. However, some annoying part of you likes how @@.girlVoice;cute@@ and @@.girlVoice;girly@@ it sounds.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $traitMentalLock&gt;&gt;\
	&#39;&#39;Mental Block&#39;&#39;
	Your mind seems to be stuck with the things you knew at $playerMaturity. No matter how many times you are taught a new lesson it never seems to stick. You can form memories okay, but new concepts just refuse to take purchase.

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $traitAgeLock&gt;&gt;\
	&#39;&#39;Everlasting Youth&#39;&#39;
	Your body is stuck at age $playerAge. No matter how long you wait you never seem to get any bigger or any older. You aren&#39;t sure if this means you might live forever, but until then you&#39;re stuck eating off the kid&#39;s menu.

Gone was the excess baby fat, leaving her slim and slight. She&#39;d also shed that childish awkwardness. She wasn&#39;t particularly fit, but she knew how to handle herself.

Her diminutive stature and slender build gave her a rather adorable figure, matched by her near constant sunny disposition.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1325" name="Miki Teen Description Relationship" tags="" position="600,16600" size="100,100">Miki wasn&#39;t the strongest student, but she was living life to the fullest in high school. Everyone loved her and she easily made friends. Her pint-sized nature made her non-threatening and her relentless optimism made her a joy to be around. Despite that it was hard not to tease her, at least a little, it was so cute watching her try to rage. She often joked about hitting another growth spurt, shooting past all of you and getting her revenge, but you very much doubted it. This was as big as Miki was going to get, and as big as she&#39;d want to be; she took an amusing amount of pride in being &quot;fun sized&quot;.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1326" name="Miki Teen Description Relationship - Clone" tags="" position="725,16600" size="100,100">Of course you looked just like her, after all the two of you were the same in every way.

You&#39;d get the same grades on a test, make the same mistakes, have the same questions undone when the bell rang. It didn&#39;t require any communication between the two of you, it was just the bond you shared. Emily occasionally decried it as &quot;creepy&quot; when the two of you talked fully in sync, but it never ceased to amuse you. You had the perfect playmate and partner for life, and she had the same in you.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1327" name="Miki Teen Description Relationship - Lilo" tags="" position="850,16600" size="100,100">The two of you were quite the popular pair, amiable, socially outgoing, with seemingly endless friends and acquaintances. Inside and outside of class you were both always surrounded by your friends. The lunch table around you was always crowded and it felt like Miki had an invite to a house party nearly every night. Everyone knew that inviting one of you meant inviting both, so you also spent a lot of time partying. It wasn&#39;t good for either of your academics, but it did wonders for your social standing. 

Everyone wanted to be Miki&#39;s friend, //especially// the boys. Something she had a wicked habit of encouraging. Her adorable giggly nature meant most boys were immediately disarmed, something you teased her about relentlessly.

Her glasses were slightly askew and every attempt made to get them back in line just misaligned them in the other direction. In contrast her outfit had been carefully prepared.

Overall she came across as someone who wanted to look &#39;put together&#39; but was just off the mark.&lt;&lt;if $traitFashionista&gt;&gt; There was also a blue hair clip, which did the real work of keeping the hair off to the side. Rolled up jacket sleeves showed just a hint of the long sleeve shirt underneath and she was constantly fiddling with it to keep the proper fold.

To this day she always tried to keep herself neat and put together, the image of a preppy girl, but something always went slightly wrong. Maybe her glasses went askew, or her hair was frizzy, or even her outfit didn&#39;t quite match. It was like her nerdy nature resisted her attempts. She always looked more at ease when she let loose. Letting her shy smile show her braces and wearing her favourite anime t-shirt.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1341" name="Kara Teen Description Relationship" tags="" position="100,16850" size="100,100">Kara was the smartest person you&#39;d ever met. You didn&#39;t know how she&#39;d compare on a global scale, but at her school she never failed to get top marks. This was a combination of a natural intelligence and an abundance of hard work. She spent far more time indoor studying than outside in the sun. This focus had left her little time for social pursuits and her friend group was fairly small. However, this was just how she liked it. She&#39;d take a few close friends over a gaggle of shallow ones any day.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1342" name="Kara Teen Description Relationship - Boyfriend" tags="" position="225,16850" size="100,100">Kara was the smartest and most beautiful person you&#39;d ever met. You didn&#39;t know how she&#39;d compare on a global scale, but she would always be number one in your eyes. This was a combination of a natural intelligence and an abundance of hard work. She spent far more time indoor studying than outside in the sun. It fell to you and the rest of the group to occasionally drag her out so people wouldn&#39;t think she was a vampire. 

Your feelings for her had started out as admiration, but have evolved into something far deeper. You love her, though you aren&#39;t quite ready to say it. You weren&#39;t even sure you were ready to kiss her, despite the encouragement of everyone else in your lives. The two of you could be so awkward that they felt compelled to rescue from your own clumsy flirting. You were meant for each other, you just had to take the last step.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1343" name="Kara Teen Description Relationship - Nerd" tags="" position="350,16850" size="100,100">Kara was the smartest person you&#39;d ever met. You were only a little jealous that you could never seem to outdo her. But you couldn&#39;t really be mad, she worked her butt off for those kind of grades. She spent far more time indoor studying than outside in the sun. 

Not that you were any better, if you weren&#39;t inside studying then the two of you were watching anime or reading comic books. Others might decry your pursuits as nerdy but...well...they were pretty nerdy. The two of you cosplayed at anime conventions. Was there anything nerdier than that?

It was just that the two of you didn&#39;t care. Neither of you had much concern for what others thought about you. Cultivating one close friend was worth far more than trying to placate the plebeians at school by being &quot;normal&quot;. Normal was boring. You accepted each other for being weirdos, and that&#39;s what was important.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1344" name="NPCs" tags="" position="475,16850" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;set _groupHappiness to getGroupFriendliness()&gt;&gt;\
